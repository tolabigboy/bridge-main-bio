Everything seemed normal with Elliott\u2019s birth, she said. In fact, he and his parents were about to be discharged from the hospital when one of the nurses noticed that Elliott\u2019s startle reflex was quite exaggerated. They decided to run more blood tests and found that there were a few abnormalities. They hoped in a few days his blood test would return to normal, but things didn\u2019t improve.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Initially a quiet baby, Elliott wasn\u2019t breast feeding and was increasingly irritable and crying. His blood and urine tests were sent to specialists at the local Children\u2019s Hospital. It was there that Elliott was diagnosed with MoCD Type A, a rare genetic disease. Elliott\u2019s father, Jeff, described what it was like to receive this diagnosis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI quizzed him [the physician], and I said, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve been given this vague idea of what\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ve been told he hasn\u2019t got long, and he will basically slowly get worse.\u2019 And the second specialist said, \u2018Well, to be quite honest, it has been known for [infants with MoCD Type A] to not make 18 weeks.\u2019 His words were, \u2018You\u2019ve got to make the most of the time you\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Elliott\u2019s parents were told that there was a drug trial for children with MoCD Type A but it was highly unlikely Elliott would be able to join it. An extraordinary series of phone calls were made and by that evening the drug was flown into Manchester Airport from Cologne, Germany. Almost immediately Elliott seemed to improve. His parents described Elliott\u2019s reaction to the treatment: \u201cWithin a few days, we\u2019d seen that he was kind of \u2014 [he] was a different baby\u2026 And it was like having a new baby a week old, one that didn\u2019t scream all the time and one that was starting to breastfeed. But it just seems that that was the beginning for us.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Today Elliott is an active child. He receives his medication daily in a central intravenous line while he eats his breakfast. He goes to playgroups and is out and about with his family. \u201cWhen it\u2019s managed,\u201d his mother says, \u201cwhich his is, they do live a normal life. And we are the product of that. And we are extremely, extremely lucky\u2026 He goes everywhere. I don\u2019t stop him from doing anything.\u201d<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":17,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[37],"class_list":["post-4625","stories","type-stories","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-patient"],"acf":{"title":"Elliot, living with MoCD Type A","teaser":"","image":{"ID":4614,"id":4614,"title":"Elliott","filename":"Elliott.png","filesize":2910443,"url":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott.png","link":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/patients-and-families\/remembering-riley\/elliott\/","alt":"","author":"17","description":"","caption":"","name":"elliott","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":4192,"date":"2021-08-13 19:01:26","modified":"2021-08-13 19:01:26","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/png","type":"image","subtype":"png","icon":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2400,"height":1400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott-150x150.png","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott-300x175.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":175,"medium_large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott-768x448.png","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":448,"large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott-1024x597.png","large-width":1024,"large-height":597,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott-1536x896.png","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":896,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Elliott-2048x1195.png","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1195}},"meta_short_title":"Elliot, living with MoCD Type A","meta_description":"","meta_share_image":false,"sidebar_content":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Elliot, living with MoCD Type A - BridgeBio<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Elliot is a well-loved boy who is living with MoCD Type A, an ultra-rare condition causing severe encephalopathy and intractable seizures.
