The cycle of hospital stays due to seizures characterized by violent muscle spasms and loss of consciousness lasted throughout her early and middle childhood.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The grand mal seizures Alexis experienced until she was eleven caused her to develop learning disabilities, and she met with a tutor every morning because of her desire to receive an education.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI still did it even though there were days I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I craved that, wanting to be a kid. I was still hurting. But it wasn\u2019t like, \u2018I can\u2019t move, I can\u2019t do it. I just had to hold on to hope. I couldn\u2019t let it go. I had to keep going,\u201d Alexis said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While hypoparathyroidism caused her to miss many of the activities common for teens, she pushed herself and became a cheerleader in high school.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At age fifteen, Alexis received the diagnosis of ADH1. \u201cWhen they did the genetic testing, they told me I had one of the rarest [forms of hypoparathyroidism],\u201d she said. \u201cI told them my story. And the doctor pretty much looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re alive!\u2019\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being told by many of her doctors she would never be able to be a mother, Alexis and her husband have two young sons \u2013 Jackson and Joseph. Throughout her pregnancies, Alexis dealt with fears of her own mortality and of the risk that her child would inherit the genetic mutation that causes ADH1. Initially, the results came back negative, but additional testing revealed that Jackson had inherited this rare condition. Upon hearing the news, Alexis felt \u201cbroken.\u201d She worried that her son would experience the same feelings of alienation, arduous medical regimens and frequent hospital stays that she did as a child.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson is now eight years old. Fortunately, due to advancements in medicine, Jackson\u2019s experience with this condition has been less difficult than his mother\u2019s. Yet, while Jackson likes to run, play outside and keep up with his friends and younger brother, he fatigues quickly and experiences pain in his stomach and arms, even when he\u2019s just watching his favorite shows. Jackson, like his mother, is resolved to keep going and play like any other child.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI just lose energy very, very fast. I feel like I\u2019m just gonna fall right over\u2026sometimes [my] arms feel like they\u2019re going to fall off,\u201d said Jackson.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Jackson\u2019s mother, Alexis, lives in pain, but continues to be determined to live through it. She wants people to know that the consequences of ADH1 can be challenging, but there is always hope.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alexis guides her son through his experience with ADH1 with compassion, empathy and faith in their combined strength to keep pushing forward. When asked if there was something Jackson wanted to tell people about his condition, he said this: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a cure yet?\u201d<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":17,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[37],"class_list":["post-4623","stories","type-stories","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-patient"],"acf":{"title":"Alexis and Jackson, living with ADH1","teaser":"","image":{"ID":5420,"id":5420,"title":"Alexis","filename":"Alexis.png","filesize":3647253,"url":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis.png","link":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/patients-and-families\/alexis\/alexis-2\/","alt":"","author":"26","description":"","caption":"","name":"alexis-2","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":4623,"date":"2022-04-08 19:49:41","modified":"2022-04-08 19:49:53","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/png","type":"image","subtype":"png","icon":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2400,"height":1400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis-150x150.png","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis-300x175.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":175,"medium_large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis-768x448.png","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":448,"large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis-1024x597.png","large-width":1024,"large-height":597,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis-1536x896.png","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":896,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Alexis-2048x1195.png","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1195}},"meta_short_title":"Alexis and Jackson, living with ADH1","meta_description":"","meta_share_image":false,"sidebar_content":[{"sidebar_text":"Do you have ADH1 or ADH2 and want to help researchers better understand your condition?
