With Canavan, there is nothing certain about tomorrow and what it may bring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 2-weeks-old, Meghan noticed that Tobin\u2019s eyes were twitching, a condition known as nystagmus. Her pediatrician told her it was a sign that Tobin\u2019s central nervous system was not developing properly. Meghan had also noted how stiff Tobin\u2019s body was from birth and how she didn\u2019t cry when she was born. She pushed Tobin\u2019s physicians to evaluate her further. At her three-month check-up things were worse. Tobin\u2019s physician sent her to an ophthalmologist who in turn sent her to a neurologist at the University of Iowa. There they admitted Tobin for further testing at the University of Iowa Stead Children\u2019s Hospital. Tobin\u2019s two day stay included an MRI, 24-hour EEG monitoring, a spinal tap and multiple blood tests. A urinalysis sent to the Mayo clinic came back with a diagnosis of Canavan\u2019s disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tobin received the diagnosis of Canavan Disease, her parents were devastated. They had never heard of Canavan before. Eventually they were introduced to the advocacy group Canavan Research Illinois. Tobin\u2019s parents say the other families they met through Canavan Research Illinois helped them respond and adapt to this challenging disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s really hard to get a fatal diagnosis [for] your child and not know anything,&#8221; Meghan said. &#8220;But those parents, they know what you&#8217;re going through. You can talk to them. Because I can&#8217;t talk to my friends about it. They don&#8217;t understand. But I can be open with the other parents and be like, \u2018This is how I feel today,\u2019 and, \u2018Is this normal?\u2019 And everybody&#8217;s like, \u2018Yep. We&#8217;ve all gone through that. It&#8217;s fine. Just breathe and go day by day.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":17,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[37],"class_list":["post-4629","stories","type-stories","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-patient"],"acf":{"title":"Tobin, a girl with Canavan disease","teaser":"","image":{"ID":4621,"id":4621,"title":"Tobin","filename":"Tobin.png","filesize":3065157,"url":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin.png","link":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/patients-and-families\/remembering-riley\/tobin\/","alt":"","author":"17","description":"","caption":"","name":"tobin","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":4192,"date":"2021-08-13 19:02:44","modified":"2021-08-13 19:02:44","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/png","type":"image","subtype":"png","icon":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2400,"height":1400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin-150x150.png","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin-300x175.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":175,"medium_large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin-768x448.png","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":448,"large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin-1024x597.png","large-width":1024,"large-height":597,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin-1536x896.png","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":896,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Tobin-2048x1195.png","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1195}},"meta_short_title":"Tobin, a girl with Canavan disease","meta_description":"","meta_share_image":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Tobin, a girl with Canavan disease - BridgeBio<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/patients-and-families\/tobin\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Tobin, a girl with Canavan disease - BridgeBio\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Tobin is a young girl with Canavan disease, an extremely rare genetic disease affecting muscular development that begins in infancy and progresses rapidly.
