Before Miguel was born, his parents Macarena and Jos\u00e9 did not know that he would have achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. In fact, it took some time for them to receive an accurate diagnosis. As with any parent, they were overcome by fear and uncertainty. \u201cFear of the unknown, because no one tells you or informs you about anything. So then, you are a little scared and a little uncertain. You think much further beyond the present and start to re-analyze all these ideas, like, what will he do when he\u2019s older? When he goes to school? How will he relate to people?\u201d says Jos\u00e9.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after his birth, Miguel began experiencing health complications and was slow to reach certain developmental milestones. He had a very intense muscular hypotonia and could barely move. At nine months, he was diagnosed with cervical spinal stenosis, which is the narrowing of the foramen magnum. Miguel faced the risk of becoming paraplegic or dying with any physical movement. Doctors recommended that Miguel undergo surgery, and while its success was not guaranteed, it was the only option.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The surgery was successful, and just months after, Miguel began experiencing rapid and positive signs of growth. At 15 months, he was starting to move and was able to support his own head. Today, with the help from physical therapy, osteopathy, and swimming, Miguel is continuing to see significant improvements.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And as for Macarena and Jos\u00e9, there is less fear and uncertainty. As they continue to learn more and meet other families living with achondroplasia, they\u2019ve been able to grasp and accept the realities of living with achondroplasia and have learned to enjoy their new normal. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundacionalpe.org\/en\/\"><strong>ALPE Achondroplasia Foundation<\/strong><\/a>, in particular, has been extremely supportive and helpful. Macarena recalls, \u201cThey are the ones who finally said, \u2018It\u2019s not a big deal. From the very beginning, we just have to work on it and be alert to certain things and certain problematic issues that these kids might have, but he\u2019s going to be a kid who will be able to get everything he wants. He will get to do it all.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With that in mind, Macarena and Jos\u00e9 have been focused on what matters most to them \u2013 preparing Miguel for the future by loving him, making him stronger, raising him with high self-esteem, and most importantly, making him happy. Macarena shares, \u201cAll I want is for him to be a happy boy, for him to smile.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Advice they would give to a family who just found out that their child was diagnosed with achondroplasia? \u201cLive in the moment because the days go by and your little ones\u2019 lives go by, and if you\u2019re worried all the time, that time is lost. It is difficult, but you have to try to take advantage of the moment, and I believe that with work and effort, things will work out,\u201d advises Jos\u00e9.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":17,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[37],"class_list":["post-2772","stories","type-stories","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-patient"],"acf":{"title":"Miguel, living with achondroplasia","teaser":"","image":{"ID":4361,"id":4361,"title":"2","filename":"2.png","filesize":496871,"url":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2.png","link":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/patients-and-families\/miguel\/2-4\/","alt":"","author":"17","description":"","caption":"","name":"2-4","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":2772,"date":"2021-08-04 17:22:09","modified":"2021-09-15 22:13:31","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image\/png","type":"image","subtype":"png","icon":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-includes\/images\/media\/default.png","width":2400,"height":1400,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2-150x150.png","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2-300x175.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":175,"medium_large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2-768x448.png","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":448,"large":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2-1024x597.png","large-width":1024,"large-height":597,"1536x1536":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2-1536x896.png","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":896,"2048x2048":"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/2-2048x1195.png","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1195}},"meta_short_title":"Miguel, living with achondroplasia","meta_description":"","meta_share_image":false,"sidebar_content":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Miguel, living with achondroplasia - BridgeBio<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Miguel is a young boy living in Spain.
