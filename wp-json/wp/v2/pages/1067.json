MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.<\/strong><\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Application<\/em>. You and we agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This section entitled \u201cMandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver\u201d is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between you and us. Any and all disputes may include, but are not limited to (i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and (iii) claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from the broad prohibition in this subsection entitled \u201cApplication\u201d are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided in the subsection entitled \u201cException\u201d below.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Initial Dispute Resolution<\/em>. Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that you will try to resolve your dispute with us before taking any formal action by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:legal@bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\">legal@bridgebiodev.wpengine.com<\/a> or Attn: Legal, c\/o BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., 42 Kipling Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301.\u00a0 When you contact us, you must provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information. If you have an account with us, you must include the email address associated with your account. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims (see the subsection entitled \u201cException\u201d below), you and we agree to use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with each other. You and we agree to engage in good faith discussions before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration and understand that good faith discussions are a precondition of initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Binding<\/em>\u00a0<em>Arbitration<\/em>. If we do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided in the subsection entitled \u201cException\u201d below), as long as the party agrees with the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms\u2019 formation, performance, and breach), the parties\u2019 relationship with each other, and\/or your use of the Platform shall \u00a0be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with either (i) the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules, for claims that do not exceed $250,000; or (ii) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, for claims exceeding $250,000. The JAMS rules and procedures just identified shall be those effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (not the Last Modified date of these Terms), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Arbitrator\u2019s<\/em>\u00a0<em>Powers<\/em>. The arbitrator (and not any federal, state, or local court or agency) shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms. Such disputes may include, but are not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator\u2019s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Filing a Demand<\/em>. To start an arbitration, you must do all three of the following: (i) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (ii) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, and (iii) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at: at <a href=\"mailto:legal@bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\">legal@bridgebiodev.wpengine.com<\/a> or Attn: Legal, c\/o BridgeBio Pharma, Inc., 42 Kipling Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys&#8217; fees unless the arbitration rules and\/or applicable law provide otherwise.\u00a0<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in California, United States, and you and us agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in California in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Class Action Waiver<\/em>. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This means that you and we expressly waive any rights to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>Exception<\/em>:\u00a0<em>Litigation<\/em>\u00a0<em>of<\/em>\u00a0<em>Intellectual<\/em>\u00a0<em>Property<\/em>\u00a0<em>and<\/em>\u00a0<em>Small<\/em>\u00a0<em>Claims<\/em>\u00a0<em>Court<\/em>\u00a0<em>Claims<\/em>. Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights. \u201cIntellectual property rights\u201d means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets\u2014but does not include privacy or publicity rights. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction. You and we agree that to the extent that either party has a good faith belief that a dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the small claims court in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence or in California, either party may elect to have such dispute adjudicated in such small claims court. Such election can be made by either party even after the other party initiates an arbitration.\u00a0 In such case, the party that initiated the arbitration agrees to dismiss or suspend the arbitration and seek to resolve the dispute in small claims court. You and we agree that in the situation where an arbitration is already initiated and one party invokes the small claims court option, any dispute regarding whether the dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court shall be resolved by the small claims court in the first instance (unless it is unwilling to do so) and not the arbitrator or JAMS.\u00a0<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small><em>30-Day<\/em>\u00a0<em>Right<\/em>\u00a0<em>to Opt Out<\/em>.

This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Section shall survive any termination of your use of the Platform.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. Termination<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small>You agree that we, in our sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your use of the Sites and remove and discard any content, including User Content, within the Sites, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms.\u00a0 Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Sites, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. We may also in our sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Sites, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Sites under any provision of this Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that we may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and\/or bar any further access to such files or the Sites. Further, you agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Sites.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. General<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us and governing your use of the Sites, superseding any prior agreements between you and us with respect to the Sites. These are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above in Section 11, you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Sites or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent, but we may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.<\/small><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14.\u00a0 Notice to California Residents<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><small>If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.
