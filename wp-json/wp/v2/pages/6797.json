She grew up in a large, busy, loving household with her parents and five siblings. \u201cI was always around kids, and life was awesome!\u201d She remembers always being slow as a child, the last one when running, playing, and riding bikes with her siblings and schoolmates. She also had trouble climbing stairs, but despite consulting many physicians, there was never an explanation. She recalls feeling humiliated in school\u2014ridiculed by her physical education teacher, who claimed she wasn\u2019t trying hard enough. She internalized the criticism, pushing herself to exercise, diet, and go to great lengths to try to fit in with her peers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-6745 size-medium\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/MLBio_Julie_Group-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Julie living with limb girdle muscular dystrophy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/>\u201cIt was at least 10 years of going to different doctors and just being told, \u2018You got to try a little harder.\u2019\u201d Finally, during a family trip, when she was unable to walk down a slope to a waterfall, her family saw that something was wrong. She was referred to a Muscular Dystrophy Association clinic and was ultimately diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. At that time, though, she was incorrectly diagnosed with facial scapular humeral dystrophy (FSH). Sometime later, when pregnant with her first child, she was finally accurately diagnosed with LGMD2I\/R9.<\/p>\n<p>Like many people living with LGMD2I\/R9, her diagnostic journey was long and confusing; Julie felt both relief and terror at finally having a name for her condition. She worried about the impact on her family and her future. \u201cBy the time that you [actually have] a diagnosis, you feel relieved, but you also feel terrified that maybe you would rather not know what\u2019s coming. [Your] mental health is very impacted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Julie was determined to live a full life and not let her disease deter her from her dream of having a family. She now has three children, whom she proudly describes as confident, loving, kind, empathetic, and helpful to others.<\/p>\n<p>There have been challenges along the way, some bad days and some wonderful days. She initially tried to hide her struggles\u2014both physical and emotional.
