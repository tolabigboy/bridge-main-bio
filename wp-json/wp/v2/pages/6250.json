(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, announced that the proof-of-concept Phase 2b data evaluating the effects of orally-administered encaleret on mineral homeostasis in patients with ADH1 were published in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMc2302708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>New England Journal of Medicine<\/em><\/a>\u00a0in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\r\n\r\n\u201cConventional therapy for ADH1 includes raising the blood calcium levels with calcium supplements and activated vitamin D, taken in multiple doses throughout day. But this burdensome regimen may also increase urine calcium levels above normal, which can damage the kidney, leading to kidney failure in worst-case scenarios. People with ADH1 need better treatments, so they are not constantly walking on a tightrope. It\u2019s been rewarding to observe the robust response in our study participants, some of whom I\u2019ve known for almost 20 years, to this investigational medication that directly targets the underlying cause and appears to restore the calcium balance back towards normal,\u201d said Rachel Gafni, M.D., the principal investigator of the study and a senior research physician in the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the NIH.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Phase 2b study, participants completed one or two 5-day inpatient dose-ranging periods, followed by a 24-week outpatient period. Encaleret was administered twice daily with doses adjusted to achieve normal albumin-corrected blood calcium levels and participants stopped taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, the standard of care for ADH1. The results showed that:\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n \t<li>Encaleret corrected hypocalcemia and reduced hypercalciuria within a few days of treatment initiation with sustained effect during the 24-week outpatient period<\/li>\r\n \t<li>As expected with elevated PTH levels, levels of bone turnover markers increased during the outpatient period, with levels in nine of 13 participants remaining normal. Long-term study will continue to assess skeletal effects<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Kidney function and preexisting renal calcifications did not worsen and will continue to be monitored in longer-term studies. No serious adverse events were reported with encaleret. Treatment-related adverse events were limited to infrequent mild, transient, asymptomatic hypophosphatemia, or hypercalcemia that resolved either spontaneously or with dose adjustment<\/li>\r\n \t<li>No treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals occurred<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\u201cThe profound impact we\u2019ve seen on mineral homeostasis in the ADH1 participants to date is deeply encouraging. Encaleret appeared to restore physiologic mineral homeostasis in 13 participants with ADH1 within days of undergoing treatment and the results continue to be sustained 18 months out from the trial\u2019s start date. We hope to see similar results in our Phase 3 trial and are excited about what this means for a patient population in need of targeted therapeutic options,\u201d Scott Adler, M.D., chief medical officer of Calcilytix, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing encaleret for ADH1.\r\n\r\nBridgeBio recently shared\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/1e594e5d-38f0-4eb6-9312-b65173862a81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">data from 18 months of outpatient treatment in the long-term extension of its Phase 2b trial<\/a>\u00a0in an oral presentation at the Endocrine Society Meeting 2023. Additionally, the Company plans additional presentations related to the program at the upcoming American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 2023 Annual Meeting.\r\n\r\nCALIBRATE, BridgeBio\u2019s Phase 3 trial (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/study\/NCT05680818?cond=autosomal%20dominant%20hypocalcemia&amp;rank=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCT05680818<\/a>) of encaleret for the treatment of ADH1 is ongoing in six countries with topline data expected in the first half of 2024. The design of the CALIBRATE study incorporates feedback from global regulatory authorities and patients, with a primary composite endpoint of blood and urine calcium concentrations within target ranges in participants treated with encaleret compared to standard of care and secondary endpoints evaluating other measures of mineral homeostasis, quality of life and kidney function.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Encaleret<\/strong>\r\nEncaleret is an investigational, orally administered small molecule that selectively antagonizes the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), targeting ADH1 at its source.\u00a0The current standard of care for patients with ADH1 includes oral calcium and\/or active vitamin D supplements that are typically administered to manage signs and symptoms associated with hypocalcemia. Encaleret has received Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the European Union.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1)<\/strong>\r\nADH1 is caused by gain-of-function variants of\u00a0the\u00a0<em>CASR<\/em>\u00a0gene encoding the CaSR. The calcium-sensing receptor regulates the extracellular calcium concentration in the body primarily through its activity in the parathyroid glands and the kidney. Due to increased sensitivity of the variant CaSR to extracellular calcium, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels, and excess excretion of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria). Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular symptoms, which can include severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to kidney calcifications and impaired kidney function.\r\n\r\nStudies estimate that there are 25,000 carriers of gain-of-function variants of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene, the underlying cause of ADH1, in the US and EU. This estimate is based on analyses of independent general population genetic datasets, including Geisinger Health System, UK Biobank, gnomAD, and TopMed.<sup>1,<\/sup><sup>2<\/sup>\r\n\r\n<strong>About BridgeBio<\/strong>\r\nBridgeBio is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced the initiation of its multicenter, international, pivotal Phase 3 randomized trial of encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) (CALIBRATE). The design of the CALIBRATE study incorporates feedback from global regulatory authorities and patients, with a primary composite endpoint of blood and urine calcium concentrations within normal ranges in participants treated with encaleret compared to standard of care (SoC). SoC for ADH1 consists of extra-dietary supplementation with calcium and\/or active vitamin D analogs. While SoC may address acute symptoms related to hypocalcemia, it may exacerbate high urine calcium levels, which can cause renal complications<sup>1<\/sup>. Secondary endpoints will evaluate other measures of mineral homeostasis, quality of life, and kidney function.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited to have reached this important milestone in the development of encaleret,\u201d said Mary Scott Roberts, executive director of clinical development at BridgeBio and clinical lead of the encaleret program. \u201cThe pivotal CALIBRATE study will evaluate the potential for encaleret to provide a meaningful benefit to patients and families living with ADH1. If successful, this study could lead to an approval of encaleret for the treatment of ADH1, a disease with significant unmet medical need and no interventions specifically indicated for its treatment.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudies estimate that there are 25,000 carriers of gain-of-function variants of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene, the underlying cause of ADH1, in the US and EU. This estimate is based on analyses of independent general population genetic datasets, including Geisinger Health System, UK Biobank, gnomAD, and TopMed.<sup>2,3<\/sup>\r\n\r\nThe CALIBRATE study advances the clinical development of encaleret following\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/news\/bridgebio-pharma-shares-positive-phase-2b-data-and-announces-pivotal-study-design-for-phase-3-trial-of-encaleret-in-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia-type-1-adh1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">positive data from an ongoing Phase 2b<\/a>\u00a0trial in 13 participants with ADH1. In the Phase 2b study encaleret was generally well-tolerated, with no observed safety signals of potential clinical concern, and restored normal mineral homeostasis. Mean values of blood calcium, urinary calcium, and blood PTH came within the normal range by day 5 of encaleret treatment and were sustained for 24 weeks. At week 24 of outpatient treatment, 92% of participants receiving encaleret achieved normal blood calcium levels in the absence of SoC, and 77% of participants had achieved normal 24-hr urinary calcium excretion. Results of this study were presented at the Endocrine Society (ENDO) Annual Conference in June 2022. The long-term extension of the Phase 2b study is ongoing.\r\n\r\n<strong>CALIBRATE Design<\/strong>\r\nThe Phase 3 multicenter, international, randomized, open-label, two-arm, three-period clinical study will assess the efficacy and safety of encaleret for 24 weeks. The trial will enroll approximately 45 participants 16 years of age or older with biochemical evidence of hyperparathyroidism (low PTH, low blood calcium, high urinary calcium) and genetic confirmation of ADH1. Following a SoC maintenance period, participants will be randomized 2:1 to the encaleret treatment arm or the SoC treatment arm and will undergo a 20-week titration period. Finally, encaleret or SoC doses will be maintained during a 4-week maintenance period where doses will only be adjusted to address potential safety concerns, including hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. The primary composite endpoint will compare the effect of encaleret to SoC on the ability to concurrently achieve blood and urine calcium within widely accepted normal ranges.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Encaleret<\/strong>\r\nEncaleret is an investigational, orally administered small molecule that selectively antagonizes the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), targeting ADH1 at its source.\u00a0The current standard of care for patients with ADH1 includes oral calcium and\/or active vitamin D supplements that are typically administered to manage signs and symptoms associated with hypocalcemia. Encaleret has received Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug status in the United States and the European Union.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1)<\/strong>\r\nADH1 is caused by gain-of-function variants of\u00a0the\u00a0<em>CASR<\/em>\u00a0gene encoding the CaSR. The calcium-sensing receptor regulates the extracellular calcium concentration in the body primarily through its activity in the parathyroid glands and the kidney. Due to increased sensitivity of the variant CaSR to extracellular calcium, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels, and excess excretion of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria). Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular symptoms, which can include severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to kidney calcifications and impaired kidney function.\r\n\r\n<strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong>\r\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced positive Phase 2b data of encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1). The results are featured in an oral presentation at the Endocrine Society (ENDO) 2022 Annual Conference in Atlanta, GA. BridgeBio will also host an investor call on June 13, 2022, at 4:30 pm ET to discuss the results from the Phase 2b study.\r\n\r\n\u201cADH1 is a rare genetic form of hypoparathyroidism associated with lifelong abnormally high urine calcium and low blood calcium levels, sometimes leading to severe consequences such as seizures, heart rhythm abnormalities, muscle cramping, and breathing difficulties,\u201d said Rachel Gafni, M.D., senior research physician and head of the Mineral Homeostasis Studies Group of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \u201cCurrent management with calcium and vitamin D supplements is inadequate and may exacerbate high urine calcium levels, which can cause kidney complications. These 24-week outpatient data, evaluating an investigational calcilytic in a precision-medicine approach, demonstrate that encaleret has the potential to restore normal calcium and phosphate metabolism in individuals with ADH1.\u201d\r\n\r\nThirteen adults with ADH1 caused by nine unique <em>CASR<\/em> variants participated in the three-period, Phase 2b, open-label, dose-ranging study. Oral calcium and activated vitamin D supplements were discontinued prior to encaleret initiation. Periods 1 and 2 each evaluated encaleret over the course of five inpatient days and Period 3 included a 24-week outpatient evaluation. Key results from the Phase 2b study include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Encaleret was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported; there were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Key biochemical parameters of mineral homeostasis, summarized in the table below, were normalized by Period 2, Day 5 and were sustained through Period 3, Week 24 of the trial<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-5534 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1356\" height=\"521\" \/>\r\n\r\n\u201cFor someone born with ADH1, the near-constant vigilance required to manage levels of calcium in the bloodstream is part of normal day-to-day life. The management helps to relieve the burden of health complications like seizures and hospitalizations, but in some cases, people still have symptoms even with astute maintenance of their condition. The possibility of a treatment option that could potentially alleviate the burden on patients and improve quality of life and health provides hope for people living with this genetic condition,\u201d said Michele Rayes, vice-chair of the board of directors of the HypoPARAthyroidism Association.\r\n\r\nThe consistent and sustained results from all periods of this Phase 2b study support the potential for encaleret to establish a clinically meaningful efficacy, tolerability and safety profile as a potential treatment of adults with ADH1. The participants who completed Period 3 of the study were eligible to continue in an open label extension of up to 25 months. The planned Phase 3 registrational study in patients with ADH1 is designed as a randomized, open-label, two-arm study comparing the effect of encaleret to standard of care on blood and urine calcium for 24 weeks. BridgeBio plans to initiate the Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2022 with an expected readout of top line data at the end of 2023.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are eager to initiate our upcoming study and plan to build upon the knowledge and experience gained from the Phase 2b clinical trial.

Parathyroid hormone levels increased in all participants and mean blood phosphate decreased into the normal range during Periods 1 and 2.

The results we are achieving with encaleret for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 in the current clinical trial are remarkable, as both blood and urine calcium normalize within five days of dosing. Given the consistent improvements seen in mineral homeostasis, we are excited about encaleret's potential to help patients with ADH1 who currently have no approved therapy indicated to treat this disease,\" said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of the cardiorenal companies at BridgeBio. \"We recognize the magnitude of the unmet need for these patients and are working collaboratively with regulators to define a path forward for registration.

Due to increased sensitivity of the CaSR to extracellular calcium, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels, and excess urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria).

(Nasdaq: BBIO),\u202fa commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver meaningful medicines for patients with genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for encaleret for the treatment of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH1). The FDA Fast Track designation program is designed to facilitate the development and to expedite the review of new therapies hoping to treat or prevent serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. BridgeBio announced the Fast Track designation on World Hypoparathyroidism Awareness Day, an annual global awareness and education event designed to spotlight and support people living with ADH1 and other types of hypoparathyroidism.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>ADH1 is a rare, genetic form of hypoparathyroidism caused by pathogenic variants in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (<em>CASR<\/em>). It is estimated that about 12,000 individuals in the United States carry such variants in <em>CASR.<\/em><sup>1<\/sup> The calcium-sensing receptor gene encodes the receptor, CaSR, which senses the level of calcium in the body and regulates the amount of calcium in the blood through its effects on the parathyroid glands, the kidney, and bone. Gain-of-function variants in <em>CASR<\/em> result in sensing low calcium as normal. As a result, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), low or low-normal parathyroid hormone levels, and excess urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria). Hypocalcemia can cause severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to impaired kidney function and kidney stone formation. The current standard-of-care for ADH1 patients consists of oral calcium supplements in excess of typical dietary requirements for people with normal CaSR function, and activated vitamin D, which can partially correct hypocalcemia but typically worsens both hypoparathyroidism and hypercalciuria.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>\u201cBalancing near-normal blood and avoiding excess urinary calcium is a daily struggle for patients with ADH1 as the range of symptoms produced by the highs and lows of the condition cannot adequately be addressed by current standard-of-care,\u201d said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of the cardio-renal affiliates at BridgeBio, including Calcilytix, which is focused on developing encaleret. \u201cWith respect to the mechanism of disease, which is driven by gain-of-function variants in <em>CASR<\/em>, encaleret, as an allosteric negative modulator of the receptor\u2019s calcium sensing activity, has the potential to correct the disease mechanism at its source. It is encouraging to receive Fast Track designation from the FDA as it recognizes the seriousness of ADH1 and the potential for encaleret to address this profound unmet medical need.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Promising early results from its ongoing Phase 2b proof-of-concept, open-label study of encaleret, orally administered, for patients with ADH1 were presented at the Endocrine Society\u2019s 2021 Annual Meeting, which showed the normalization of blood calcium and urine calcium in six of six (100%) ADH1 participants evaluated over five days and demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept.<sup>2<\/sup> BridgeBio plans to engage with regulatory health authorities to discuss the design of a Phase 3 registrational study in patients with ADH1.

ADH1 is a rare, inherited disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) resulting in abnormally low serum calcium and high urine calcium and a range of debilitating symptoms.

The CaSR is a G-protein-coupled receptor for which extracellular calcium is the primary ligand.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, announced that the proof-of-concept Phase 2b data evaluating the effects of orally-administered encaleret on mineral homeostasis in patients with ADH1 were published in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMc2302708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>New England Journal of Medicine<\/em><\/a>\u00a0in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\r\n\r\n\u201cConventional therapy for ADH1 includes raising the blood calcium levels with calcium supplements and activated vitamin D, taken in multiple doses throughout day. But this burdensome regimen may also increase urine calcium levels above normal, which can damage the kidney, leading to kidney failure in worst-case scenarios. People with ADH1 need better treatments, so they are not constantly walking on a tightrope. It\u2019s been rewarding to observe the robust response in our study participants, some of whom I\u2019ve known for almost 20 years, to this investigational medication that directly targets the underlying cause and appears to restore the calcium balance back towards normal,\u201d said Rachel Gafni, M.D., the principal investigator of the study and a senior research physician in the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the NIH.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Phase 2b study, participants completed one or two 5-day inpatient dose-ranging periods, followed by a 24-week outpatient period. Encaleret was administered twice daily with doses adjusted to achieve normal albumin-corrected blood calcium levels and participants stopped taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, the standard of care for ADH1. The results showed that:\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n \t<li>Encaleret corrected hypocalcemia and reduced hypercalciuria within a few days of treatment initiation with sustained effect during the 24-week outpatient period<\/li>\r\n \t<li>As expected with elevated PTH levels, levels of bone turnover markers increased during the outpatient period, with levels in nine of 13 participants remaining normal. Long-term study will continue to assess skeletal effects<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Kidney function and preexisting renal calcifications did not worsen and will continue to be monitored in longer-term studies. No serious adverse events were reported with encaleret. Treatment-related adverse events were limited to infrequent mild, transient, asymptomatic hypophosphatemia, or hypercalcemia that resolved either spontaneously or with dose adjustment<\/li>\r\n \t<li>No treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals occurred<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\u201cThe profound impact we\u2019ve seen on mineral homeostasis in the ADH1 participants to date is deeply encouraging. Encaleret appeared to restore physiologic mineral homeostasis in 13 participants with ADH1 within days of undergoing treatment and the results continue to be sustained 18 months out from the trial\u2019s start date. We hope to see similar results in our Phase 3 trial and are excited about what this means for a patient population in need of targeted therapeutic options,\u201d Scott Adler, M.D., chief medical officer of Calcilytix, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing encaleret for ADH1.\r\n\r\nBridgeBio recently shared\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/1e594e5d-38f0-4eb6-9312-b65173862a81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">data from 18 months of outpatient treatment in the long-term extension of its Phase 2b trial<\/a>\u00a0in an oral presentation at the Endocrine Society Meeting 2023.

The design of the CALIBRATE study incorporates feedback from global regulatory authorities and patients, with a primary composite endpoint of blood and urine calcium concentrations within target ranges in participants treated with encaleret compared to standard of care and secondary endpoints evaluating other measures of mineral homeostasis, quality of life and kidney function.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Encaleret<\/strong>\r\nEncaleret is an investigational, orally administered small molecule that selectively antagonizes the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), targeting ADH1 at its source.\u00a0The current standard of care for patients with ADH1 includes oral calcium and\/or active vitamin D supplements that are typically administered to manage signs and symptoms associated with hypocalcemia. Encaleret has received Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the European Union.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1)<\/strong>\r\nADH1 is caused by gain-of-function variants of\u00a0the\u00a0<em>CASR<\/em>\u00a0gene encoding the CaSR. The calcium-sensing receptor regulates the extracellular calcium concentration in the body primarily through its activity in the parathyroid glands and the kidney. Due to increased sensitivity of the variant CaSR to extracellular calcium, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels, and excess excretion of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria). Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular symptoms, which can include severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to kidney calcifications and impaired kidney function.\r\n\r\nStudies estimate that there are 25,000 carriers of gain-of-function variants of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene, the underlying cause of ADH1, in the US and EU. This estimate is based on analyses of independent general population genetic datasets, including Geisinger Health System, UK Biobank, gnomAD, and TopMed.<sup>1,<\/sup><sup>2<\/sup>\r\n\r\n<strong>About BridgeBio<\/strong>\r\nBridgeBio is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced the initiation of its multicenter, international, pivotal Phase 3 randomized trial of encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) (CALIBRATE). The design of the CALIBRATE study incorporates feedback from global regulatory authorities and patients, with a primary composite endpoint of blood and urine calcium concentrations within normal ranges in participants treated with encaleret compared to standard of care (SoC). SoC for ADH1 consists of extra-dietary supplementation with calcium and\/or active vitamin D analogs. While SoC may address acute symptoms related to hypocalcemia, it may exacerbate high urine calcium levels, which can cause renal complications<sup>1<\/sup>. Secondary endpoints will evaluate other measures of mineral homeostasis, quality of life, and kidney function.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are excited to have reached this important milestone in the development of encaleret,\u201d said Mary Scott Roberts, executive director of clinical development at BridgeBio and clinical lead of the encaleret program. \u201cThe pivotal CALIBRATE study will evaluate the potential for encaleret to provide a meaningful benefit to patients and families living with ADH1. If successful, this study could lead to an approval of encaleret for the treatment of ADH1, a disease with significant unmet medical need and no interventions specifically indicated for its treatment.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudies estimate that there are 25,000 carriers of gain-of-function variants of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene, the underlying cause of ADH1, in the US and EU. This estimate is based on analyses of independent general population genetic datasets, including Geisinger Health System, UK Biobank, gnomAD, and TopMed.<sup>2,3<\/sup>\r\n\r\nThe CALIBRATE study advances the clinical development of encaleret following\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/news\/bridgebio-pharma-shares-positive-phase-2b-data-and-announces-pivotal-study-design-for-phase-3-trial-of-encaleret-in-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia-type-1-adh1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">positive data from an ongoing Phase 2b<\/a>\u00a0trial in 13 participants with ADH1. In the Phase 2b study encaleret was generally well-tolerated, with no observed safety signals of potential clinical concern, and restored normal mineral homeostasis. Mean values of blood calcium, urinary calcium, and blood PTH came within the normal range by day 5 of encaleret treatment and were sustained for 24 weeks. At week 24 of outpatient treatment, 92% of participants receiving encaleret achieved normal blood calcium levels in the absence of SoC, and 77% of participants had achieved normal 24-hr urinary calcium excretion. Results of this study were presented at the Endocrine Society (ENDO) Annual Conference in June 2022. The long-term extension of the Phase 2b study is ongoing.\r\n\r\n<strong>CALIBRATE Design<\/strong>\r\nThe Phase 3 multicenter, international, randomized, open-label, two-arm, three-period clinical study will assess the efficacy and safety of encaleret for 24 weeks. The trial will enroll approximately 45 participants 16 years of age or older with biochemical evidence of hyperparathyroidism (low PTH, low blood calcium, high urinary calcium) and genetic confirmation of ADH1. Following a SoC maintenance period, participants will be randomized 2:1 to the encaleret treatment arm or the SoC treatment arm and will undergo a 20-week titration period. Finally, encaleret or SoC doses will be maintained during a 4-week maintenance period where doses will only be adjusted to address potential safety concerns, including hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. The primary composite endpoint will compare the effect of encaleret to SoC on the ability to concurrently achieve blood and urine calcium within widely accepted normal ranges.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Encaleret<\/strong>\r\nEncaleret is an investigational, orally administered small molecule that selectively antagonizes the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), targeting ADH1 at its source.\u00a0The current standard of care for patients with ADH1 includes oral calcium and\/or active vitamin D supplements that are typically administered to manage signs and symptoms associated with hypocalcemia.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced positive Phase 2b data of encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1). The results are featured in an oral presentation at the Endocrine Society (ENDO) 2022 Annual Conference in Atlanta, GA. BridgeBio will also host an investor call on June 13, 2022, at 4:30 pm ET to discuss the results from the Phase 2b study.\r\n\r\n\u201cADH1 is a rare genetic form of hypoparathyroidism associated with lifelong abnormally high urine calcium and low blood calcium levels, sometimes leading to severe consequences such as seizures, heart rhythm abnormalities, muscle cramping, and breathing difficulties,\u201d said Rachel Gafni, M.D., senior research physician and head of the Mineral Homeostasis Studies Group of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \u201cCurrent management with calcium and vitamin D supplements is inadequate and may exacerbate high urine calcium levels, which can cause kidney complications. These 24-week outpatient data, evaluating an investigational calcilytic in a precision-medicine approach, demonstrate that encaleret has the potential to restore normal calcium and phosphate metabolism in individuals with ADH1.\u201d\r\n\r\nThirteen adults with ADH1 caused by nine unique <em>CASR<\/em> variants participated in the three-period, Phase 2b, open-label, dose-ranging study. Oral calcium and activated vitamin D supplements were discontinued prior to encaleret initiation. Periods 1 and 2 each evaluated encaleret over the course of five inpatient days and Period 3 included a 24-week outpatient evaluation. Key results from the Phase 2b study include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Encaleret was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported; there were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Key biochemical parameters of mineral homeostasis, summarized in the table below, were normalized by Period 2, Day 5 and were sustained through Period 3, Week 24 of the trial<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-5534 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1356\" height=\"521\" \/>\r\n\r\n\u201cFor someone born with ADH1, the near-constant vigilance required to manage levels of calcium in the bloodstream is part of normal day-to-day life. The management helps to relieve the burden of health complications like seizures and hospitalizations, but in some cases, people still have symptoms even with astute maintenance of their condition. The possibility of a treatment option that could potentially alleviate the burden on patients and improve quality of life and health provides hope for people living with this genetic condition,\u201d said Michele Rayes, vice-chair of the board of directors of the HypoPARAthyroidism Association.\r\n\r\nThe consistent and sustained results from all periods of this Phase 2b study support the potential for encaleret to establish a clinically meaningful efficacy, tolerability and safety profile as a potential treatment of adults with ADH1. The participants who completed Period 3 of the study were eligible to continue in an open label extension of up to 25 months. The planned Phase 3 registrational study in patients with ADH1 is designed as a randomized, open-label, two-arm study comparing the effect of encaleret to standard of care on blood and urine calcium for 24 weeks. BridgeBio plans to initiate the Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2022 with an expected readout of top line data at the end of 2023.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are eager to initiate our upcoming study and plan to build upon the knowledge and experience gained from the Phase 2b clinical trial. People with ADH1 are in serious need of treatment options, and we hope to reach them quickly with a meaningful therapy,\u201d said Mary Scott Roberts, M.D., senior director of clinical development at BridgeBio and clinical lead of the encaleret program.\r\n\r\nAt ENDO 2022, BridgeBio also <a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/news\/bridgebio-pharma-to-present-phase-2b-data-and-pivotal-phase-3-study-design-of-encaleret-in-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia-type-1-adh1-at-the-endocrine-society-endo-2022-annual-conference\/\">shared<\/a> poster presentations on its achondroplasia program, including preclinical data on hypochondroplasia, as well as an ePoster about its congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) program.\r\n\r\n<strong>Webcast Information<\/strong>\r\nBridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the full Phase 2b data and pivotal study design for its Phase 3 trial for encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 on June 13, 2022\u00a0at\u00a04:30 pm ET.

Encaleret has received Fast Track Designation by the FDA and Orphan Drug status in the United States and European Union.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1)<\/strong><strong>\r\n<\/strong>ADH1 is caused by gain-of-function variants of\u00a0the <em>CASR <\/em>gene encoding the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) which are estimated to be carried by 12,000 individuals in the United States.<sup>1<\/sup>\u00a0The calcium-sensing receptor senses and regulates the level of extracellular calcium in the body through its activity in the parathyroid glands and the kidney. Due to increased sensitivity of the variant CaSR to extracellular calcium, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels, and excess urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria). Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular symptoms, which can include severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to kidney calcifications and impaired kidney function.\r\n\r\n<strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.

Hypocalcemia can cause severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to impaired kidney function and kidney stone formation. The current standard-of-care for ADH1 patients consists of oral calcium supplements in excess of typical dietary requirements for people with normal CaSR function, and activated vitamin D, which can partially correct hypocalcemia but typically worsens both hypoparathyroidism and hypercalciuria.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>\u201cBalancing near-normal blood and avoiding excess urinary calcium is a daily struggle for patients with ADH1 as the range of symptoms produced by the highs and lows of the condition cannot adequately be addressed by current standard-of-care,\u201d said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of the cardio-renal affiliates at BridgeBio, including Calcilytix, which is focused on developing encaleret. \u201cWith respect to the mechanism of disease, which is driven by gain-of-function variants in <em>CASR<\/em>, encaleret, as an allosteric negative modulator of the receptor\u2019s calcium sensing activity, has the potential to correct the disease mechanism at its source.

Patients with ADH1 experience a range of symptoms associated with low blood calcium and high urine calcium, which cannot be adequately addressed with current standard of care therapies,\u201d said Rachel Gafni, M.D., Senior Research Physician and Head, Mineral Homeostasis Studies Group of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health (NIH). \u201cIn these initial results from the Phase 2b study of encaleret in ADH1, blood and urine calcium levels were normalized in all trial participants within five days of treatment.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In these data from the ongoing Phase 2b open-label, dose-ranging study, six adults with ADH1 with four distinct<em> CASR<\/em> genotypes were administered encaleret. Calcitriol (active Vitamin D) therapy (current standard of care) was discontinued prior to and throughout the study. Non-dietary calcium supplements were withheld in five participants with adequate dietary calcium intake. Participants received sequential, increasing daily doses of encaleret starting at 30 mg while undergoing intensive safety monitoring and frequent blood and urine sampling for biochemical measures. Following five days of dosing with encaleret, blood calcium, parathyroid hormone, phosphorus and magnesium were within the normal range on average.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) affiliate Calcilytix Therapeutics, Inc. announced today the initiation of a Phase 2 single-center study of encaleret (CLTX-305) in individuals with ADH1 conducted at the National Institutes of Health. ADH1 is a rare, inherited disease caused by gain-of-function mutations in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) resulting in abnormally low serum calcium and high urine calcium and a range of debilitating symptoms. Encaleret sulfate is an investigational oral therapy being studied to address ADH1 at its source by antagonizing the CaSR.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>\u201cPatients with ADH1 are currently treated with calcium supplements with a goal of raising their serum calcium levels toward the normal range. Unfortunately, conventional therapy can exacerbate patients\u2019 high urine calcium levels and lead to kidney stones and long-term kidney injury,\u201d said Michael Collins, M.D., Senior Investigator, Skeletal Disorders and Mineral Homeostasis Section of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, part of the National Institutes of Health. \u201cWe are working with BridgeBio and Calcilytix to investigate whether encaleret, a therapy that targets the root cause of this disease, could potentially be considered as a future treatment option for our patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Phase 2 trial will enroll up to 16 individuals with ADH1 in an open-label, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of single and multiple doses of encaleret. This study will include two treatment cohorts evaluated over three study periods, including inpatient observation at the NIH. If doses of encaleret are observed to be well-tolerated and demonstrate the potential to normalize blood and urine calcium levels, participants may be treated for up to 26 weeks.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>\u201cEncaleret has been previously shown to be well-tolerated and increase serum calcium levels in healthy volunteers and individuals with osteoporosis, a profile that encouraged our investigation of the compound in ADH1 patients,\u201d said Jonathan C. Fox, M.D., Ph.D., Calcilytix\u2019s Chief Medical Officer. \u201cIf successful, this initial study will provide clear proof of concept that antagonizing the CaSR can address the underlying cause of ADH1. Our goal is to develop an approved treatment to substantially reduce the current unmet medical need for these patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The company expects to report topline proof-of-concept results from this Phase 2 study in 2021.

The CaSR is a G-protein-coupled receptor for which extracellular calcium is the primary ligand. Conceptually, the major physiologic role of the CaSR is to function as a \u2018calciostat\u2019 and maintain serum calcium levels by regulating the release of PTH and renal calcium reabsorption.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>ADH1 is caused by rare gain-of-function mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene. ADH1 is characterized by increased sensitivity of the CaSR to calcium levels, which results in a physiological \u2018perception\u2019 that normal blood calcium levels are high, leading to decreased production of parathyroid hormone and diminished reabsorption of calcium from the urine.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Individuals with ADH1 present with low serum calcium, low or low-normal parathyroid hormone levels and excess urinary excretion of calcium. Symptoms resulting from low levels of serum calcium, or hypocalcemia, may include severe muscle cramping, tetany and seizures. In addition, relatively high levels of calcium in urine, a condition called hypercalciuria, may result in kidney stone formation and impaired kidney function.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>About Encaleret (CLTX-305)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Encaleret is an investigational small molecule antagonist of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) and is being studied as a potential treatment for ADH1.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
