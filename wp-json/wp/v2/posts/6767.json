(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to BBP-812, an investigational intravenous (IV) adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease. RMAT designation was granted following the FDA\u2019s review of clinical data from the CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u00a0Phase 1\/2 clinical trial investigating BBP-812 as a potential therapy to address the unmet medical needs of individuals with Canavan disease.<\/p>\n<p>RMAT is an expedited FDA program available to sponsors of regenerative medicine therapies intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure serious conditions. Benefits of the RMAT designation include all the advantages of the Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation programs, including faster and more frequent interactions with the FDA to achieve early alignment on critical aspects of the program. FDA granted RMAT designation based on its review of 12 months of safety and efficacy data from the first eight patients with Canavan disease dosed with BBP-812 in the CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u00a0Phase 1\/2 clinical trial.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are honored to be granted RMAT designation for BBP-812 and are eager to work closely with the FDA and the Canavan community with the goal of bringing our therapy to families living with Canavan disease as fast as possible,\u201d said Eric David, M.D., J.D., CEO at BridgeBio Gene Therapy. \u201cWe are beyond grateful to the children and their families who are participating in CAN<em>aspire,\u00a0<\/em>as well as to the study investigators. RMAT will allow us to work more closely with FDA to ensure we are responding to the urgency that families feel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To date, results from CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u00a0show that all patients dosed\u00a0with at least one follow-up assessment have\u00a0demonstrated improvements in functional outcomes in key areas important to caregivers such as head control, sitting upright, reaching for and grasping objects, and visual tracking. All patients dosed with BBP-812 with at least one follow-up assessment have shown\u00a0reductions in N-acetylaspartate (NAA), both in urine and in the central nervous system, to levels associated with mild disease. BBP-812 has been well-tolerated, with a safety profile generally consistent with that of other AAV9 gene therapy programs.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201c<\/em>Canavan disease is an extremely rare and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that prevents most children from meeting basic developmental milestones, such as crawling, walking, speaking, and even holding their heads up. It is a terminal diagnosis with no approved treatment to date. The news of the RMAT designation, coupled with the preliminary results seen in the clinical trial, provides hope to children worldwide living with Canavan disease and their families,\u201d said Kathleen Flynn, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/ntsad.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">National Tay-Sachs &amp; Allied Diseases Association<\/a>, an advocacy organization dedicated to driving research, forging collaboration, and supporting families within the Tay-Sachs, Canavan, GM1, and Sandhoff disease communities.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to RMAT designation, BBP-812 has been granted Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease (RPDD), and Fast Track Designations from the FDA, as well as Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency. With RPDD, if approved, BridgeBio may qualify for a Priority Review Voucher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About CANaspire<\/strong><br \/>\nCANaspire is a Phase 1\/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic activity of BridgeBio\u2019s AAV9 gene therapy candidate, BBP-812, in pediatric patients with Canavan disease. Each eligible patient will receive a single IV infusion of BBP-812. The primary outcomes of the study are safety, as well as change from baseline of urine and central nervous system NAA levels. Motor function and development will also be assessed.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the CANaspire trial, visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.treatcanavan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">TreatCanavan.com<\/a>\u00a0or ClinicalTrials.gov (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/study\/NCT04998396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCT04998396<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Canavan Disease<\/strong><br \/>\nAffecting approximately 1,000 children in the U.S. and European Union, Canavan disease is an ultra-rare, disabling and fatal disease with no approved therapy. Most children are not able to meet developmental milestones, are unable to crawl, walk, sit or talk, and die at a young age. The disease is caused by an inherited mutation of the\u00a0<em>ASPA<\/em>\u00a0gene that codes for aspartoacylase, a protein that breaks down a compound called NAA. Deficiency of aspartoacylase activity results in accumulation of NAA, and ultimately results in toxicity to myelin in ways that are not currently well understood. Myelin insulates neuronal axons, and without it, neurons are unable to send and receive messages as they should. The current standard of care for Canavan disease is limited to supportive therapy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
