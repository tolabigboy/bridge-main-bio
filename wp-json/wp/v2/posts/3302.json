These forward-looking statements, including statements relating to expectations, plans and prospects regarding the preclinical and clinical development plans, clinical trial designs, clinical and therapeutic potential, and strategy of our product candidates, including, but not limited to: the unknown future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic delay on certain clinical trial milestones and\/or our operations or operating expenses;; the timing and success of our planned preclinical and clinical development of our development programs, including each of infigratinib, BBP-631 and encaleret; the timing and success of any such continued preclinical and clinical development and planned regulatory submissions, including for each of infigratinib, BBP-631 and encaleret; the potential therapeutic and clinical benefits of each of infigratinib, BBP-631 and encaleret; the potential size of the target patient populations for each of infigratinib, BBP-631 and encaleret; the potential for encaleret to be the first approved therapy for ADH1; our expected runway for cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; and the timing of these events, reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved.
