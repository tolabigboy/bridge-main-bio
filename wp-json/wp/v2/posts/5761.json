By combining SHP2 inhibition with KRAS G12C inhibition in patients with the\u00a0<em>KRAS\u00a0<\/em>G12C mutation, there is potential to prevent oncogenesis and overactive cellular proliferation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe survival rate following a diagnosis of NSCLC with a\u00a0<em>KRAS\u00a0<\/em>mutation is extremely poor. We are hopeful that by launching this clinical trial with Amgen, we may be able to fill the current gap in unmet medical need for these cancer patients,\u201d said Frank McCormick, Ph.D., chairman of oncology at BridgeBio. \u201cWe are grateful the FDA has granted our program Fast Track designation and are hopeful it will allow us to address the needs of these patients more quickly following diagnosis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Phase 1\/2 study will include a dose escalation period followed by dose expansion and optimization, and is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of BBP-398 in combination with LUMAKRAS. The dose escalation period will enroll patients with all solid tumors with a\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0G12C mutation and participants will be eligible regardless of previous exposure to a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The dose expansion period will enroll patients with NSCLC with a\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0G12C mutation who have not previously been exposed to a KRAS G12C inhibitor. Initial data is expected by the end of 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of BBP-398 in combination with LUMAKRAS for adult patients with previously treated,\u00a0<em>KRAS\u00a0<\/em>G12C-mutated, metastatic NSCLC. The FDA\u2019s Fast Track designation is designed to drive the development and expedite the review process for medicines under investigation for serious conditions with unmet medical needs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To date, preclinical data for SHP2 inhibition has shown promise in unlocking possible combination strategies to treat patients suffering from a range of cancers, including NSCLC. By combining SHP2 inhibition with KRAS G12C inhibition, there is potential for this therapeutic arsenal to be impactful for patients since it could prevent overactive cellular proliferation and oncogenesis. I am extremely pleased to see that work from our group and others has now reached the clinic, where we will be able to study the benefit it could have for cancer patients with\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0G12C mutations,&#8221; said Benjamin G. Neel, M.D., Ph.D., Co-founder of Navire Pharma Inc. (Navire), a BridgeBio company, and Director of the L\/I Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone and Professor of Medicine at NYU Grossman SoM.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople with metastatic NSCLC with a\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0mutation often do not respond well to standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy options. They might have a worse prognosis than patients without a\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0mutation and it is essential to deliver better therapeutic options to people with this difficult-to-treat cancer. I am hopeful that by partnering with BridgeBio on this study we may be able to provide substantial relief for patients with a serious unmet need,\u201d said Rohit Joshi, M.D., Director for Cancer Research SA (CRSA) and Associate Professor at the University of Adelaide.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2022, BridgeBio entered into an exclusive license agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop and commercialize BBP-398 in oncology worldwide, except for in mainland China and other Asian markets. These territories are part of BridgeBio\u2019s separate strategic collaboration with LianBio announced in 2020. The 2022 agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb expands upon the earlier agreement between the companies signed in 2021 to investigate the combination of BBP-398 with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors with\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0mutations.<\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio has a non-exclusive clinical collaboration with Amgen to evaluate the combination of BBP-398 with LUMAKRAS in patients with advanced solid tumors with the\u00a0<em>KRAS\u00a0<\/em>G12C mutation.<\/p>\n<p>BBP-398, as a monotherapy or in combination with other targeted therapies, could potentially be a promising therapy for patients with the\u00a0<em>KRAS\u00a0<\/em>G12C mutation. Initial Phase 1 data from the ongoing BBP-398 trial is expected in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) is a trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BBP-398<\/strong><br \/>\nBBP-398 is a SHP2 inhibitor that is being developed for difficult-to-treat cancers and was founded through a collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\u2019s Therapeutics Discovery division. SHP2 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that links growth factor, cytokine and integrin signaling with the downstream RAS\/ERK MAPK pathway to regulate cellular proliferation and survival. In May 2022, BridgeBio entered an exclusive license with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop and commercialize BBP-398, a potentially best-in-class SHP2 inhibitor. Additionally, BridgeBio has a strategic collaboration with LianBio for clinical development and commercialization of BBP-398 in combination with various agents in solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, in mainland China and other Asian markets and clinical collaborations; with Bristol Myers Squibb for combination with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors with\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em>\u00a0mutations; and with Amgen for combination with LUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib), Amgen\u2019s KRAS G12C\u00a0inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors with\u00a0<em>KRAS\u00a0<\/em>G12C\u00a0mutations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
