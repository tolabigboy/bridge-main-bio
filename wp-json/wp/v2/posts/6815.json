(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, announced, on LGMD Awareness Day, the completion of enrollment of FORTIFY, the Company\u2019s Phase 3 registrational study of BBP-418 in individuals with LGMD2I\/R9.<\/p>\n<p>FORTIFY is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of BBP-418, an investigational oral therapy in development for the treatment of individuals living with LGMD2I\/R9. The study includes a planned interim analysis at 12 months focused on assessing glycosylated \u03b1DG as a surrogate endpoint to potentially support Accelerated Approval. The primary endpoint, to be evaluated at 36 months, is the North Star Assessment (NSAD) for limb-girdle type muscular dystrophies and is designed to provide confirmatory clinical data supporting the efficacy of BBP-418. More information about the Phase 3 clinical trial of BBP-418 (NCT05775848) can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT05775848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>\u00a0on clinicaltrials.gov. A topline data readout from the interim analysis is expected in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLiving with a progressive muscle wasting condition like LGMD2I\/R9 means that individuals are continually losing the ability to perform daily activities independently and relying on friends and family to support them as they experience a continued decline in strength and health. For patients with LGMD2I\/R9, there are currently no approved treatment options, but the promise seen in the rapid enrollment of this clinical trial provides hope for patients and their families that this may change in the future,\u201d said Kelly Brazzo, CEO of CureLGMD2i Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCompleting rapid enrollment of FORTIFY is an important milestone and underscores the need for a therapeutic option for patients,\u201d said Douglas Sproule, M.D., M.Sc., Chief Medical Officer of ML Bio Solutions, a BridgeBio company developing BBP-418 for LGMD2I\/R9. \u201cBased on multiple encouraging discussions with the FDA, we believe there is an opportunity to pursue Accelerated Approval in the U.S. for BBP-418 in LGMD2I\/R9 based on a potential surrogate endpoint biomarker of glycosylated \u03b1DG at time of the interim analysis. If successful, BBP-418 could be the first approved disease-modifying therapy for individuals living with LGMD2I\/R9 in the U.S. We\u2019re immensely grateful to the patients, their families, and the trial site investigators participating in our study and look forward to sharing pivotal data with the community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>BBP-418 has previously received Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the FDA and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Consistent with the Rare Pediatric Designation from the FDA, if BBP-418 is approved, BridgeBio may qualify for a Priority Review Voucher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2I\/R9 (LGMD2I\/R9)<\/strong><br \/>\nLGMD2I\/R9 is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by partial loss of function mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene, and FKRP mutations impair glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1DG), a protein associated with stabilizing muscle cells. Clinical manifestations typically present as a skeletal myopathy affecting the lower and then upper limbs, which is commonly later accompanied by respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle involvement. Individuals who harbor a homozygous L276I genotype typically develop disease manifestations during late childhood with progression to loss of independent ambulation (25%), assisted ventilation (10%), and cardiomyopathy (30%) in adulthood. Cardiomyopathy is progressive, with an annual loss of 0.4% of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Individuals with other FKRP genotypes typically have an earlier childhood onset with a more severe clinical course, rapid loss of mobility by 20 years of age, more frequent cardiac involvement (60%), and eventual respiratory failure by 30 years of age in nearly all cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
