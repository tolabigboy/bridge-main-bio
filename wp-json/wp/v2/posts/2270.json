(Nasdaq: BBIO),\u00a0today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 and provided an update on the company\u2019s operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The company is working with its committed partners to minimize disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic on its clinical trials and other drug development programs. BridgeBio salutes the brave physicians, nurses, first responders and medical staff who are working across the globe to care for patients with COVID-19.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio\u2019s fully enrolled trials and preclinical programs are moving ahead with minimal delays, and the company is on track to file its second New Drug Application (NDA) later this year, along with the anticipated filing of multiple investigational new drug applications (INDs). Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, BridgeBio\u2019s clinical trials of infigratinib in tumors with FGFR genetic alterations are proceeding as planned.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Certain clinical trials that were in the process of enrolling have slowed as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. BridgeBio is working with hospitals and investigators to deliver investigational medicines to patients and to develop solutions that will allow the company to continue to measure key endpoints for these trials. BridgeBio is also prepared to continue enrolling patients as the healthcare system regains the ability to accommodate this activity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For trials that have not yet begun enrolling, BridgeBio is prepared to begin them as soon as trial sites can accommodate enrollment. Given the severe and often life-threatening nature of many of the disease areas on which BridgeBio is focused, we anticipate many of our planned trials will be prioritized.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cGiven COVID-19\u2019s impact, we estimate that certain milestones related to clinical trials that were anticipated in 2020 are now more likely to come in 2021. Other programs are moving forward without delay, thanks to the committed efforts of our partners,\u201d said BridgeBio founder and CEO Neil Kumar, Ph.D. \u201cWe believe we are in a position financially and operationally to move our critical work forward the moment the public health situation allows for that. Many of the patients we work with are battling devastating diseases that will not wait for this pandemic to pass.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just prior to substantial market dislocation driven by COVID-19, BridgeBio strengthened its balance sheet by raising $550 million in gross proceeds through the issuance of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2027 (2027 Notes). This important financing added to approximately $700 million in gross proceeds raised from our initial public offering in June 2019 and Series D announced in January 2019, and puts BridgeBio in a strong financial position to execute on the 20+ drug development and discovery programs in its pipeline.\u00a0 The company expects current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to carry it through critical and high-value milestones stretching into 2022.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cOur recent financings have focused on solving for two objectives at once: securing the capital required to independently advance our pipeline, while minimizing shareholder dilution,\u201d said BridgeBio CFO Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA. \u201cOne of the original goals in the founding of BridgeBio was to create a vehicle that could attract a new set of investors to fund critical biomedical research and drug development by taking a sufficiently large number of shots on goal, within an advantaged research and development space, to build conviction that multiple approved products are not just possible but statistically probable over time.\u00a0 We appreciate the confidence investors have demonstrated in the critical work we are doing for patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steps BridgeBio has taken in response to COVID-19<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Delivering investigational medicines to trial participants directly now that many can no longer visit the hospital<\/li>\r\n<li>Implementing out-of-hospital solutions for clinical trials \u2013 including telehealth appointments and remote clinical monitoring<\/li>\r\n<li>Engaging in conversations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) across multiple programs to understand how to preserve the fidelity of key endpoints<\/li>\r\n<li>Working closely with contract manufacturing partners to anticipate potential downstream impacts to BridgeBio\u2019s immediate supply chain<\/li>\r\n<li>Working on key aspects of site activation and support so that BridgeBio can continue enrolling patients where and when possible<\/li>\r\n<li>Transferring many of our non-clinical laboratory activities to contract research organizations that continue to work on them, when BridgeBio has not been able to sustain them<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First quarter 2020 and recent pipeline progress:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mendelian<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>BBP-589 \u2013 COL7A protein replacement therapy for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB):<\/strong> Due to a slowdown in enrollment related to COVID-19, BridgeBio now plans to share topline data from the ongoing Phase 1\/2 study (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03752905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>NCT03752905<\/strong><\/a>) in 2021.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>BBP-265 (AG10) \u2013 TTR stabilizer for ATTR:<\/strong>\u00a0 Due to a slowdown in site activation and participant enrollment related to COVID-19, BridgeBio currently expects enrollment of ATTRibute-CM to be completed in the first half of 2021\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03860935\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>ATTRibute-CM<\/strong><\/a>) and plans to initiate its Phase 3 trial of AG10 in ATTR-PN (ATTRibute-PN) in the second half of 2020<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Low-dose infigratinib for achondroplasia:<\/strong>The Phase 2 clinical program\u00a0(PROPEL2) is on track to dose the first children in 2020 (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04265651\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>NCT04265651<\/strong><\/a>).

The increase in operating expenses of $38.7 million was attributable to the increase in external-related costs and increase in headcount to support the progression in our research and development programs, including our increasing research pipelines, and overall growth of our operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We have experienced some delays in our research and development activities arising from delays in enrollment of certain of our ongoing clinical trials and in the commencement of certain planned trials due to the global outbreak of COVID-19.
