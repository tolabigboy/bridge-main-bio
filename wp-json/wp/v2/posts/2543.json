(Nasdaq: BBIO) affiliate QED Therapeutics announced today that the first child with achondroplasia has been dosed with the investigational medicine infigratinib, an orally available small molecule, that targets the overactivity of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) in the PROPEL 2 Phase 2 <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04265651?term=infigratinib&amp;cond=achondroplasia&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">clinical trial<\/a>. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature.<sup>1<\/sup> \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWith preclinical evidence showing increased growth in the long bones, spine and cranial bones, including the base of the skull, there is the potential for infigratinib to help children with achondroplasia by decreasing the impact of serious medical complications,\u201d said Professor Ravi Savarirayan, M.B., B.S., M.D., Ph.D., clinical geneticist and group leader of skeletal biology and disease at Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Australia and the lead investigator for the PROPEL 2 trial. \u201cAdditionally, infigratinib is being studied as a once-daily dose taken orally, which is an important factor for administration of therapies to children with achondroplasia.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Achondroplasia is caused by an alteration in the <em>FGFR3<\/em> gene, which causes the FGFR3 protein to be overly active.<sup>1<\/sup> This interferes with skeletal development and can lead to disturbances in bone growth.<sup>1 <\/sup>Infigratinib is an oral investigational medicine that is designed to reduce the activity of FGFR3.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe start of this clinical trial is the culmination of more than two years of work \u2013 first to secure rights to develop infigratinib, which we pursued following the publication of data relating to its potential in achondroplasia, and then to establish preclinical data showing the efficacy and safety of very low doses of the molecule,\u201d said Michael Henderson, M.D., CEO of QED Therapeutics. \u201cInfigratinib illustrates the heart of what BridgeBio set out to do: leverage the highest quality science to identify and develop potential therapies that target genetically driven conditions at their source. Our hope is that a daily, oral dose of infigratinib, which directly targets FGFR3, can provide health benefits for children with achondroplasia.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The PROPEL 2 trial is a Phase 2 dose escalation and dose expansion trial and the first clinical trial to study infigratinib at low doses in children with achondroplasia. The goal of the study is to assess safety and measure changes from baseline in annualized height velocity and changes in other health factors. To be eligible for the trial, children must first complete a six-month period of assessment in the <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04035811?term=qed&amp;cond=achondroplasia&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PROPEL<\/a> prospective clinical assessment study.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About QED Therapeutics<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qedtx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">QED Therapeutics<\/a>, an affiliate of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine for FGFR-driven diseases. Our lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that we are evaluating in clinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia. We plan to conduct further clinical trials to evaluate the potential for infigratinib to treat patients with FGFR-driven tumor types and rare disorders. At much higher doses, infigratinib has shown activity that we believe to be meaningful in clinical measures, such as overall response rate, in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED intends to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for second and later-line cholangiocarcinoma in 2020.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on QED Therapeutics, please visit the company\u2019s website at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qedtx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.qedtx.com<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BridgeBio<\/a> is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
