(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, today announced the initiation of a scientific collaboration with the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cards-lab.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CarDS Lab<\/a>, led by cardiologist-data scientist, Rohan Khera, M.D., M.S. at Yale School of Medicine, to help address the underdiagnosis of ATTR-CM.<\/p>\n<p>The TRACE-AI Network Study will be deployed as a novel paradigm of large-scale federated screening for ATTR-CM that harnesses a central repository of validated AI tools across multiple participating sites to evaluate the scale of ATTR-CM underdiagnosis across the U.S. The participating sites in the network will aim to evaluate the scale of underdiagnosis among key socioeconomic and demographic subpopulations, estimate the prevalence of presymptomatic phenotypes of people with ATTR-CM, and assess the association between high-risk ATTR-CM on opportunistic testing and adverse clinical outcomes across the Network.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At BridgeBio, we have long invested in computational approaches to aid drug discovery; similarly, by using AI with real-world data streams, we have a unique opportunity to improve the detection and optimize the utilization of advanced diagnostic testing. In this national initiative, we will deploy scalable and accessible strategies that improve the diagnosis and prediction of ATTR-CM in diverse populations, which has long been an unmet need in this category,\u201d said Jennifer Hodge, Ph.D., Vice President of Evidence Generation at BridgeBio.<\/p>\n<p>The CarDS Lab has developed a series of novel deep learning tools applied to real-world data sets, including AI-electrocardiography (AI-ECG), AI-point-of-care ultrasound (AI-POCUS), and AI-echocardiography (AI-Echo), which may be capable of identifying those with potentially missed ATTR-CM, such as those with heart failure, with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This strategy not only offers a novel and accessible method for early disease detection but also serves as a valuable tool for risk stratification, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the current diagnostic processes in healthcare systems.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first time, the TRACE-AI Network Study represents a convergence of cutting-edge technology and clinical expertise aimed at addressing the challenges currently seen in ATTR-CM diagnosis across large, diverse U.S. health systems,&#8221; said Dr. Khera. &#8220;One key aspect of our technology is its applicability to data routinely available at the point of care, which will enable us to facilitate widespread deployment, providing access to traditionally disadvantaged groups.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEarly detection is critical for someone with ATTR-CM, and evidence suggests that ATTR-CM is markedly underdiagnosed due to its complex presentation. This initiative is incredibly important toward improving diagnosis across the U.S. and potentially improving outcomes for patients in need,\u201d said Ahmad Masri, M.D., M.S., Cardiomyopathy Section Head and Director of the Cardiac Amyloidosis Program at Oregon Health &amp; Science University and Steering Committee Member of the TRACE-AI Network.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Additionally, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cards-lab.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CarDS Lab<\/a>\u00a0will present original research funded by BridgeBio that supports the tools utilized in the TRACE-AI Network Study at the European Society of Cardiology\u2019s (ESC) Congress 2024.
