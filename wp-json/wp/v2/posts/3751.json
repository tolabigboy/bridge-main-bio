Our first FDA approval in February was a significant milestone for us as a company, but more importantly marked a turning point for MoCD Type A patients and their families, who now have an approved therapy for the first time,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder Neil Kumar, Ph.D. \u201cWe hit the first of four major clinical data readouts anticipated over the next 12 months, reporting proof-of-concept data for encaleret in ADH1 that offers promise to patients in need. And we entered into a partnership with Helsinn Group, designed to help us reach as many patients as possible living with FGFR-driven cancers through our anticipated upcoming launch of infigratinib.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Major milestones anticipated in 2021 or early 2022 for BridgeBio\u2019s four core value drivers:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Acoramidis\u00a0(AG10) \u2013 Transthyretin\u00a0(TTR) stabilizer for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM):\u00a0Topline results from Part A of the ATTRibute-CM trial are expected in late 2021 or early 2022 and from Part B in 2023. If Part A is successful, BridgeBio expects to submit an application for regulatory approval of acoramidis in 2022. ATTR is a form of amyloidosis caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein. It is estimated to affect more than 400,000 people worldwide and is largely undiagnosed today.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Encaleret\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)\u00a0inhibitor for ADH1:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/a2cb4e3b-9442-476f-91d8-f50bb3561522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Early results from an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept study<\/a> shared at the Endocrine Society\u2019s 2021 Annual Meeting (ENDO) in March 2021 showed normalization of blood calcium and urine calcium in 6 of 6 (100%) ADH1 participants. If the development program is successful, encaleret could be the first approved therapy for ADH1, a condition caused by gain of function variants in the CaSR gene estimated to be carried by 12,000 individuals in the United States alone.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Low-dose\u00a0infigratinib\u00a0\u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia:\u00a0Initial data from the ongoing Phase 2 dose ranging study are expected by the end of 2021. Achondroplasia is the most common form of genetic short stature and one of the most common genetic diseases, with a prevalence of greater than 55,000 cases in the United States and European Union. Low-dose infigratinib is the only known product candidate in clinical development for achondroplasia that targets the disease at its genetic source and the only orally administered product candidate in clinical-stage development.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>BBP-631 \u2013 AAV5 gene therapy candidate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH):\u00a0Investigational New Drug (IND) application cleared by the FDA and site activation for initiation of a first-in-human Phase 1\/2 study is ongoing, with initial data anticipated in late 2021 or early 2022. CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases potentially addressable with AAV gene therapy, with more than 75,000 cases estimated in the United States and European Union. The disease is caused by deleterious mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, leading to lack of endogenous cortisol production. BridgeBio\u2019s AAV5 gene therapy candidate is designed to provide a functional copy of the 21-hydroxylase-encoding gene (CYP21A2) and potentially address many aspects of the disease course.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent pipeline progress and corporate updates:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Received FDA approval for NULIBRY\u2122 (fosdenopterin) for injection in February 2021 as the first therapy to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MoCD Type A, an ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorder that progresses rapidly, results in severe and largely irreversible neurological injury, and has a high infant mortality rate.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Launched strategic collaboration with Helsinn Group in March 2021 to co-develop and commercialize infigratinib in oncology.

The open-label extension (OLE) study is being continued at present at the behest of the patient foundations and physician leaders in the field. LEO Pharma, which entered into a strategic collaboration with PellePharm in 2018, has terminated its option to acquire PellePharm.

The net increase in balance of $394.2 million is attributed to $731.4 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (2029 Notes), offset by a $61.3 million payment related to capped call options and a $50.0 million payment to repurchase shares of BridgeBio common stock, both in relation to the issuance of our 2029 Notes. In connection with our acquisition of Eidos, we also paid $59.1 million in direct transaction costs and $21.3 million to Eidos stockholders who elected cash settlement. The remaining change of $145.5 million primarily related to payments of interest and operating expenses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Operating Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $168.0 million as compared to $102.5 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses of $65.5 million during the period is attributable to the increase in personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees to support the progression in our research and development programs, including our increasing research pipelines, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation related to the achievement of various performance-based milestone compensation arrangements tied to regulatory and development milestones. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $34.9 million as compared to $10.2 million for the same period in the prior year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our research and development expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global outbreak of COVID-19 for the periods presented. While we experienced some delays in certain of our clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, we continue to adapt in this unprecedented time to enable alternative site, telehealth and home visits, at-home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with our contract manufacturing organizations. The longer-term impact, if any, of COVID-19 on our operating expenses is currently unknown.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"955\" height=\"852\" class=\"wp-image-3752\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-1.jpg 955w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-1-300x268.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-1-768x685.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1006\" height=\"868\" class=\"wp-image-3753\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-2.jpg 1006w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-2-300x259.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/bbio-q1-2021-earning-report-image-2-768x663.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px\" \/>\r\n<figcaption>(1) The condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 are derived from the audited consolidated financial states as of that date.<br \/>(2) March 31, 2021 amount includes long-term marketable securities of $82.2 million.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
