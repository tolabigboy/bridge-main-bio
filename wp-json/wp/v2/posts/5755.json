(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on genetic diseases and cancers, and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (Sentynl), a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative therapies to patients living with rare diseases owned by Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. (formerly known as Cadila Healthcare Ltd.), today announced the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for NULIBRY<strong>\u00ae<\/strong>\u00a0(fosdenopterin) for Injection as the first therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A. MoCD Type A is an ultra-rare and progressive condition known to impact less than 150 patients globally with a median survival of four years.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">NULIBRY is a first-in-class cPMP substrate replacement therapy that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MoCD Type A. Following this decision by the EC, NULIBRY is the first and only approved therapy in the European Union (EU) for MoCD Type A.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In March 2022, Sentynl acquired the global rights to NULIBRY and is responsible for the ongoing development and commercialization of NULIBRY in the United States and developing, manufacturing, and commercializing fosdenopterin globally. Sentynl and BridgeBio share development responsibilities through the approval of the marketing authorization application under accelerated assessment with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and through approval of NULIBRY\u2019s regulatory submission with the Israeli Ministry of Health.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">&#8220;The European Commission&#8217;s approval of NULIBRY is an exciting step in delivering this therapy to all children suffering with MoCD Type A worldwide, and it bolsters our belief at BridgeBio that no disease is too rare to address. We are grateful that the European Commission sees the value of this treatment, and to the patients, caregivers, physicians, scientists, and advocates whose efforts made this possible,&#8221; said BridgeBio founder and CEO Neil Kumar, Ph.D.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The EC authorization follows the positive opinion granted by European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in July 2022, which was supported by data from three clinical trials that demonstrated the efficacy of NULIBRY for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A compared to data from a natural history study. These studies showed that in the genotype-matched analysis, patients treated with NULIBRY had 7.1 times lower risk of death than their historical control counterparts from the natural history study, with 86% of NULIBRY-treated patients surviving at three years compared to 52% of the genotype-matched control group.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThe approval of NULIBRY by the European Commission is a promising development for children with MoCD Type A. Zydus Group is committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of people suffering from rare and orphan diseases. This approval brings us closer to realizing our purpose of empowering people with the freedom to live healthier and more fulfilled lives,\u201d said Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences, the parent company of Sentynl Therapeutics.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThis is a major milestone for those patients living with MoCD Type A in Europe,\u201d said Matt Heck, CEO of Sentynl. \u201cMarketing authorization is an important step in providing access to NULIBRY and creating awareness of MoCD Type A as many patients are often missed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The EC&#8217;s centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. A regulatory filing is expected in the coming months to the UK&#8217;s Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as part of the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure. Sentynl expects to make NULIBRY available following successful completion of country-by-country health authority discussions. Until such time, NULIBRY will be made available to qualified patients through an Early Access Program.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In July 2022, BridgeBio received New Drug Application (NDA) Approval of NULIBRY as a treatment for MoCD Type A from the Israeli Ministry of Health.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Type A<\/strong><br \/>\nMoCD Type A is an autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the molybdenum cofactor synthesis 1 gene and characterized by a deficiency in molybdenum cofactor production, leading to a lack of molybdenum-dependent enzyme activity.<sup>1,2<\/sup>\u00a0 The lack of activity leads to decreased sulfite oxidase activity with buildup of sulfite and secondary metabolites (such as S-sulfocysteine) in the brain, which causes irreversible neurological damage.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">MoCD Type A is an ultra-rare disease. The incidence and prevalence of MoCD Type A in the European Union are not known, but the estimated prevalence (0.005 per 10,000).\u00a0Based on these estimates, MoCD Type A is likely to be underdiagnosed.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The most common presenting symptoms of MoCD Type A are seizures, feeding difficulties and encephalopathy. Patients with MoCD Type A who survive beyond infancy typically suffer from progressive brain damage, which presents in characteristic patterns on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This damage leads to severe psychomotor impairment and an inability to make coordinated movements or communicate with their environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About NULIBRY<\/strong><strong>\u00ae<\/strong><strong>\u00a0(fosdenopterin) for Injection<br \/>\n<\/strong>NULIBRY\u00ae(fosdenopterin) for Injection is a substrate replacement therapy that provides an exogenous source of cPMP, which is converted to molybdopterin. Molybdopterin is then converted to molybdenum cofactor, which is needed for the activation of molybdenum-dependent enzymes, including sulfite oxidase, an enzyme that reduces levels of neurotoxic sulfites. It is the first and only FDA-approved therapy indicated to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MoCD Type A, and clinical trials have demonstrated that patients treated with NULIBRY or rcPMP had an improvement in overall survival compared to the untreated, genotype-matched, historical control group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><br \/>\n<sup>1<\/sup>\u00a0Mechler K et al.
