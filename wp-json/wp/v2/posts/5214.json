(Nasdaq: BBIO), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced preclinical findings for its SHP2 inhibitor, BBP-398, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results are featured in a <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/f2395287-1e83-4203-8b05-d3d771b1e599\">poster presentation<\/a> titled \u2018BBP-398, a potent, small molecule inhibitor of SHP2, enhances the response of established NSCLC xenografts to KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> and EGFR<sup>mut<\/sup> inhibitors\u2019 at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics taking place virtually on October 7 \u2013 10, 2021.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to share our promising preclinical data in non-small cell lung cancer models, which provides a critical step in understanding the potential that BBP-398 has for patients with tumors driven by RAS or other MAPK-pathway activating mutations,\u201d said Eli Wallace, Ph.D., chief scientific officer at BridgeBio Oncology. \u201cFor patients with this type of progressive cancer, there is a serious need for more innovative medicines to be accessible as quickly as possible. Our potentially best-in-class SHP2 inhibitor could be an ideal combination agent for certain cancer patients given its promising profile of preclinical results and potential for once daily dosing.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-398, developed in collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\u2019s Therapeutics Discovery division, exhibits preclinical monotherapy efficacy in RTK\/KRAS-driven xenograft models as well as synergy in combination with both sotorasib and osimertinib. The predicted human steady-state plasma concentration-time profiles suggest continuous once daily oral dosing of BBP-398 may achieve the desired therapeutic index for patients.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is currently advancing its Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial with its SHP2 inhibitor, BBP-398, in patients with solid tumors driven by mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including RAS and receptor tyrosine kinase genes. More than 30% of all human cancers \u2013 including 95% of pancreatic cancers and 45% of colorectal cancers \u2014 are driven by mutations of the RAS family of genes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio\u2019s precision oncology programs are driven by the Company\u2019s molecular dynamics and RAS structural biology platforms, which are enabled by our broad partnerships with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and National RAS Initiative, respectively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio\u2019s SHP2 inhibitor, BBP-398, is one of the Company\u2019s 14 programs that are in the clinic or commercial setting for patients living with genetic diseases and genetically-driven cancers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about the preclinical data for BBP-398 at BridgeBio\u2019s upcoming virtual R&amp;D Day on Tuesday, October 12, 2021 at 8:30 am ET. The event will be webcast and registration information can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/wsw.com\/webcast\/cc\/bbio2\/register.aspx?conf=cc&amp;page=bbio2&amp;url=https:\/\/wsw.com\/webcast\/cc\/bbio2\/1408212\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio will unveil new programs, share new information about its pipeline and discuss how it is broadening the scope of its R&amp;D engine. It will also cover the Company\u2019s most significant near-term catalysts with a focus on the upcoming topline results for acoramidis, BridgeBio\u2019s investigational therapy for transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR). ATTR is a rare heart condition with a progressive and debilitating impact on quality of life likely affecting more than 400,000 patients worldwide.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Topline acoramidis results from Part A are expected in late 2021 and from Part B in 2023. The primary endpoint at Part A is the change from baseline in a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) in trial participants receiving acoramidis or placebo after 12 months. If the change from baseline in 6MWD in Part A is highly statistically significant, BridgeBio expects to submit an application for regulatory approval of acoramidis in 2022 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The R&amp;D Day program importantly and additionally will highlight BridgeBio\u2019s broader efforts in cardiorenal, progress in its KRAS portfolio, and advancements in its previously disclosed early-stage Mendelian programs. The Company will also be unveiling new investigational programs in gene therapy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About SHP2<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SHP2 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that links growth factor, cytokine and integrin signaling with the downstream RAS\/ERK MAPK pathway to regulate cellular proliferation and survival. Overactivity of the SHP2 pathway, often driven by distinct genetic mutations, is a critical contributor to many forms of cancer, and is a mechanism of resistance to several targeted therapies. Estimated to affect approximately 500,000 patients in the United States and the European Union, cancers that are driven by hyperactive MAPK signaling, including certain RAS mutations such as KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>, may be sensitive to SHP2 inhibition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BBP-398<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-398 is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable SHP2 inhibitor that demonstrates pathway inhibition across a panel of cell lines with active MAPK signaling. The therapy is designed to be optimized for continuous once daily dosing through its pharmacokinetic profile. The inhibitor was developed through a collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\u2019s Therapeutics Discovery division. BridgeBio has a non-exclusive, co-funded clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of BBP-398 with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS mutations. The collaboration will also include the initiation of a Phase 1\/2 study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of BBP-398 in combination with both OPDIVO as doublet therapy, and OPDIVO plus a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor as triplet therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS mutations, as first- and second-line treatment options. Additionally, BridgeBio previously entered into a strategic collaboration with LianBio for clinical development and commercialization of BBP-398 in combination with various agents in solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, in mainland China and other major Asian markets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
