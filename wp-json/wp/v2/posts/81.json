(Eidos) (Nasdaq<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=lBb59mmbWf38g4Ws5B7Vu-BuZFIKcAf_wsmS0q7o30CVwFUomG1-8582R_1b1m0JRZFtw3OQJzKXMTjb_n4wIg%3D%3D\">:EIDX)<\/a>, announced today that the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) within the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion for the designation of Eidos\u2019 product candidate, AG10, as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR). In addition, the EMA also granted a product-specific pediatric investigational plan waiver to Eidos for AG10.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>TTR normally circulates as a four-part molecule or tetramer, but in ATTR the molecule dissociates into individual monomers, which are unstable and aggregate as amyloid fibrils. Eidos\u2019 lead product candidate, AG10, is designed to target ATTR at its source by stabilizing tetrameric TTR in the blood.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are pleased to have received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and now a positive opinion from the EMA as well. Eidos is excited about the opportunity to work with the ATTR patient and provider community on the further development of AG10 for ATTR,\u201d noted Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., president and chief medical officer of Eidos. \u201cImportantly, AG10 has demonstrated potent stabilization of tetrameric TTR in our clinical program, and we believe maximizing the level of TTR stabilization will lead to optimal clinical benefit for patients living with this devastating disease.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Orphan Designation by the European Commission provides regulatory and financial incentives for the development of medicines that treat a<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting less than five in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). Orphan Designation provides Eidos with certain benefits, including EU market exclusivity upon regulatory approval, if received, reductions in EMA application fees, and access to protocol assistance. Eidos is pursuing AG10 for the treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) and ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), both of which are progressive, fatal diseases. The company plans to initiate Phase 3 studies in each indication in the first half of 2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About AG10<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 is an investigational, orally administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric transthyretin, or TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to amyloidosis, or ATTR. AG10 is currently being examined in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy and symptomatic heart failure. Results from this trial will be presented on November 10, 2018 at the American Heart Association\u2019s Annual Scientific Sessions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 was designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a \u201crescue mutation\u201d because it has been shown to prevent ATTR in individuals also carrying a pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutation in the other copy of their TTR gene. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in development that has been observed to mimic the \u201csuper-stabilizing\u201d properties of this rescue mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Eidos Therapeutics<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Eidos Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the large and growing unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR).
