The Company has also filed a Marketing Authorization Application for acoramidis with the EMA, which has been accepted for review.<\/li>\n<li>The regulatory filings were based on data from the Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study, which met its primary endpoint (Win Ratio of 1.8) with a highly statistically significant p-value (p&lt;0.0001). Additional results from ATTRibute-CM include:\n<ul type=\"square\">\n<li>An 81% survival rate on acoramidis, which approaches the survival rate in the age-matched U.S. database (~85%), and a 0.29 mean annual CVH rate on acoramidis, which approaches the annual hospitalization rate observed in the broader U.S. Medicare population (~0.26);<\/li>\n<li>Improvements from baseline observed for a large proportion of participants treated with acoramidis on laboratory and functional measures including n-terminal prohormone of brain natriuiretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and 6-minute walk distance;<\/li>\n<li>Rapid clinical benefit on the composite endpoint of ACM and CVH in participants treated with acoramidis, demonstrated by placebo and acoramidis time-to-first event Kaplan-Meier curves for a composite of ACM and CVH that separated at Month 3 and continued to diverge steadily through Month 30 as presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November 2023; and<\/li>\n<li>Acoramidis was well-tolerated with no safety signals of potential clinical concern identified.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>The Company also shared positive results of an open-label, single-arm Phase 3 study conducted in Japan by licensing partner Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease, including that no mortality was reported over the 30 month acoramidis treatment period.<\/li>\n<li>Additional detailed results of ATTRibute-CM are planned for presentation at 2024 medical meetings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-dose infigratinib \u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia:<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>In December 2023, the Company announced the dosing of the first child in PROPEL 3, its global Phase 3 registrational study of infigratinib in achondroplasia.<\/li>\n<li>In February 2024, the Company announced a partnership with Kyowa Kirin wherein the Company grants Kyowa Kirin an exclusive license to develop and commercialize infigratinib for achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and other skeletal dysplasias in Japan; in exchange, the Company will receive an upfront payment of $100 million as well as royalties up to the high-twenties percent on sales of infigratinib in Japan, with the potential for additional milestone-based payments.<\/li>\n<li>The Company is committed to exploring the potential of infigratinib on the wider medical and functional impacts of achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias, and anticipates initiating its clinical program for hypochondroplasia in 2024.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>BBP-418 \u2013 Glycosylation substrate for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I\/R9 (LGMD2I\/R9):<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>FORTIFY, the global Phase 3 registrational trial of BBP-418, continues to enroll in the U.S. with clinical trial sites planned\u00a0for Europe and Australia. Full enrollment of the interim analysis population is expected in 2024.

The net decrease of $73.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term restricted cash was primarily attributable to net cash used in operating activities of $527.7 million and $6.9 million in repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholdings, primarily offset by net proceeds received of $449.8 million from various equity financings, $6.0 million from stock option exercises, and $3.4 million from common stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan during the year ended December\u00a031, 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenue for the three months and year ended December\u00a031, 2023 were $1.7 million and $9.3 million, respectively, as compared to $1.9 million and $77.6 million for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The net decreases of $0.2 million and $68.3 million for the three months and year ended December\u00a031, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, were primarily due to license revenue recognized in 2022 upon the transfer of the license in accordance with the Navire-BMS License Agreement which was entered into in May 2022.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Operating costs and expenses for the three months and year ended December\u00a031, 2023 were $179.2 million and $616.7 million, respectively, compared to $131.1 million and $589.9 million, for the same periods in the prior year, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The overall increase of $48.1 million in operating costs and expenses for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in research and development and other expenses (R&amp;D) to advance the Company&#8217;s pipeline of development programs, an increase of $15.7 million in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses to support commercialization readiness efforts, offset by a decrease of $6.9 million in restructuring, impairment and related charges given that the majority of the restructuring initiatives occurred in the prior year.<\/p>\n<p>The overall increase of $26.8 million in operating costs and expenses for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 , compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to an increase of $55.2 million in R&amp;D expenses to advance the Company&#8217;s pipeline of development programs, an increase of $7.4 million in SG&amp;A expenses to support commercialization readiness efforts, offset by a decrease of $35.8 million in restructuring, impairment and related charges given that the majority of the restructuring initiatives occurred in the prior year.<\/p>\n<p>Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three months and year ended December\u00a031, 2023, amounted to $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively. These charges primarily consisted of winding down, exit costs, and severance and employee-related costs. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the same periods in the prior year were $7.7 million and $43.8 million, respectively. These charges primarily consisted of impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, severance and employee-related costs, and exit and other related costs.<\/p>\n<p>Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2023 were $37.1 million, of which $22.5 million is included in R&amp;D expenses, and $14.6 million is included in SG&amp;A expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the same period in the prior year were $22.6 million, of which $8.9 million is included in R&amp;D expenses, and $13.6 million is included in SG&amp;A expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 were $115.0 million, of which $61.6 million is included in R&amp;D expenses, and $53.4 million is included in SG&amp;A expenses.

million is included in SG&amp;A expenses, and $1.2 million is included in restructuring, impairment and related charges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cComing off of our recent royalty financing, we find ourselves well capitalized to launch acoramidis this year alongside strong new partners who share our confidence in acoramidis\u2019 potential in the ATTR-CM market,\u201d said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA, Chief Financial Officer of BridgeBio. \u201cWe are excited for this launch, as well as for the continued advancement of our late stage pipeline, which we hope will allow us to serve patients with genetic diseases both directly with the advancement of those medicines towards the market as well as by diversifying our top line revenue and enabling reinvestment into the R&amp;D and business development opportunities that will allow us to be sustainable in the long term.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"extended-table-container\">\n<div class=\"table-wrap\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div
