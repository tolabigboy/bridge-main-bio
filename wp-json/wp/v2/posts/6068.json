(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced the presentation of detailed positive results from its Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study of acoramidis for patients with ATTR-CM by Julian Gillmore, MBBS, M.D., Ph.D., FRCP, FRCPath, in a Hot Line session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2023.\u00a0In July, BridgeBio\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/bridgebio-announces-consistently-positive-results-phase-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">announced<\/a>\u00a0positive topline results from ATTRibute-CM, which was designed to study the efficacy and safety of acoramidis, an investigational, next-generation, orally-administered, highly potent small molecule stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR). BridgeBio will host an investor call on August 28, 2023, at 8:30 am ET to discuss these results.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe results of the ATTRibute-CM study of acoramidis in ATTR cardiomyopathy stand out for me as a clinician, not only for the highly significant outcome on the primary endpoint but for the consistency of treatment benefit across components of the primary and key secondary endpoints,\u201d said Dr. Gillmore. \u201cThese results contribute to my anticipation that acoramidis will provide patients and their providers with an attractive new treatment option that will surely be welcomed across the community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A highly statistically significant result, demonstrated by a Win Ratio of 1.8 (p&lt;0.0001), was observed on the primary endpoint (a hierarchical analysis prioritizing in order: ACM, then frequency of CVH, then change from baseline in NT-proBNP, then change from baseline in 6MWD). This result was consistent across both variant and wild-type ATTR-CM patients, as well as across NYHA Class I, II and III patients.<\/p>\n<p>Other key results from the study at Month 30 included:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>An 81% survival rate on acoramidis (versus a 74% survival rate on placebo) for an absolute risk reduction of 6.4% and a relative risk reduction of 25%, despite a ~50% higher rate of tafamidis use on the placebo arm relative to the treatment arm\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>The on-treatment 81% survival rate, the highest observed rate in a controlled, prospective study of ATTR-CM patients to the Company\u2019s knowledge, approaches the survival rate in the age-matched US database (~85%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Of note, overall 79% of deaths in the study were cardiovascular (CV) in nature, and the results for CV-related mortality were consistent with what was observed on ACM\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>The treatment group experienced a 14.9% CV-related mortality rate versus a 21.3% CV-related mortality rate in the placebo group, for a relative risk reduction of 30% on CV-related mortality<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>A highly statistically significant relative risk reduction of 50% (p&lt;0.0001) on frequency of CVH\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>The 0.29 mean annual CVH frequency on acoramidis approaches the annual hospitalization rate observed in the broader US Medicare population (~0.26)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>A highly statistically significant treatment effect (p&lt;0.0001 in each case) at 30 months on change from baseline in each of NT-proBNP, KCCQ, and 6MWD\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>A higher proportion of individuals experienced a reduction (improvement from baseline) in NT-proBNP on acoramidis (45%) relative to placebo (9%)<\/li>\n<li>A higher proportion of individuals experienced an increase (improvement from baseline) in 6MWD on acoramidis (40%) relative to placebo (22%)<\/li>\n<li>To the company\u2019s knowledge, these on-treatment proportions of improving patients are higher than have been observed in prior controlled studies of ATTR-CM<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>As measured by ex vivo assays of TTR stabilization, acoramidis achieved a greater degree of TTR stabilization as compared to clinically relevant concentrations of tafamidis, independent of TTR genotype<\/li>\n<li>Serum TTR was promptly and consistently elevated throughout the study in patients receiving acoramidis\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>In an exploratory post-hoc analysis of the relationship between on-treatment serum TTR levels and on-treatment measures of CVH, NT-proBNP, and KCCQ, there appears to be an association between the mean on-treatment TTR level and each of these three variables<\/li>\n<li>In a comparative exploratory post hoc analysis enabled by tafamidis drop-in, albeit at low patient numbers, acoramidis showed a 42% greater increase in serum TTR levels relative to placebo + tafamidis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Acoramidis was generally well-tolerated with no safety findings of potential clinical concern<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThe consistently positive results of ATTRibute-CM, from the primary endpoint and its components to secondary endpoints of mortality, morbidity, physical function and quality of life, further substantiate our hypothesis that highly potent TTR stabilization has the potential to deliver differential benefits to patients,\u201d said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., President, and Chief Medical Officer of BridgeBio Cardiorenal. \u201cIn particular, we observed absolute survival and hospitalization rates approaching those of similarly aged populations not afflicted with ATTR-CM. That 45% of completers displayed improvement from baseline in NT-proBNP, and 40% walked farther in 6 minutes at study end compared to baseline, are to me remarkable observations in a cohort with a disease commonly described as relentlessly progressive. The prompt and sustained observed increase in serum TTR, an in vivo reflection of increased stabilization, serves to further strengthen the relationship between measures of acoramidis\u2019 ability to avidly bind and stabilize TTR and the read-through to robust clinical benefits for patients with ATTR-CM. We look forward to engaging with health authorities in our continuing efforts to secure acoramidis\u2019 registration that will lead to our bringing acoramidis to ATTR-CM patients as quickly as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Company intends to submit its NDA to the US FDA before the end of 2023, with regulatory filings in additional markets to follow in 2024. Acoramidis has intellectual property protection out to at least 2039.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Webcast Information<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the additional data presented at ESC 2023 for the ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 trial on Monday, August 28 at 8:30 am ET.
