(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio or the Company), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022 and provided an update on the Company\u2019s operations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are excited to enter 2023 back on the doorstep of potentially meaningful advances for the patients we serve,&#8221; said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., founder and CEO of BridgeBio. &#8220;Amidst our six ongoing Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials, we anticipate important upcoming readouts from our achondroplasia Phase 2 trial in March, and our ATTR-CM Phase 3 trial mid-year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>BridgeBio\u2019s key programs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acoramidis\u00a0(AG10) \u2013 Transthyretin\u00a0(TTR) stabilizer for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM):<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study continues to have high operating fidelity.<\/li>\n<li>The Company expects to announce topline registrational data for the month 30 primary endpoint, a hierarchical composite including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, in mid-2023.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-dose\u00a0infigratinib\u00a0\u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In July 2022, we reported initial data from the fourth dosing cohort of the Phase 2 dose-escalation trial PROPEL 2, demonstrating a mean change from baseline in annualized height velocity (AHV) of +1.52 cm\/year and a responder rate of 64% in children five years of age and older.<\/li>\n<li>Through the fifth dosing cohort to date, infigratinib has been well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported, no adverse events that required discontinuation reported, and with no dose-dependent phosphate elevation reported.<\/li>\n<li>The Company expects to share preliminary data from the fifth dosing cohort in March 2023, and to initiate a registrational Phase 3 trial in 2023.<\/li>\n<li>In Cohort 5, the Company hopes to observe a tolerability profile and efficacy at least in-line with Cohort 4. If successful, the Company believes infigratinib, if approved, has the potential to capture a significant share of the market based on blinded market research.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Encaleret \u2013 Calcium-sensing receptor (<\/strong><strong><em>CaSR<\/em><\/strong><strong>) inhibitor for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1):<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In December 2022, the Company initiated the CALIBRATE Phase 3 trial, a pivotal trial comparing the effects of encaleret to standard of care on blood calcium concentration and 24-hour urine calcium excretion over a 24-week treatment period in patients with ADH1.<\/li>\n<li>In a Phase 2b safety and efficacy trial of encaleret for ADH1, 69% of the participants achieved concurrent values of both blood calcium concentration and 24-hour urine calcium excretion within the reference range after 24 weeks of outpatient encaleret treatment; none of these individuals attained this dual therapeutic goal while on standard of care.<\/li>\n<li>Population genetics analyses estimate approximately 25,000 carriers of gain-of-function variants of the CaSR, the underlying cause of ADH1, in the US and EU.<\/li>\n<li>The Company anticipates sharing topline data from CALIBRATE in late 2023 or the first half of 2024.<\/li>\n<li>If approved, encaleret could be the first therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of ADH1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>BBP-418 \u2013 Glycosylation substrate for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i (LGMD2I):<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The Company reported positive top line data from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in October 2022 and anticipates initiating a global Phase 3 registrational trial of BBP-418 for LGMD2I in 2023.<\/li>\n<li>To that end, the Company has engaged with regulatory authorities to align on a Phase 3 trial design.<\/li>\n<li>BBP-418 has a potentially-addressable population of 7,000 LGMD2I patients in the US and EU.<\/li>\n<li>There are currently no disease-modifying treatments available for LGMD2I.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>BBP-631 \u2013 AAV5 gene therapy candidate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH):<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The Phase 1\/2 gene therapy trial of BBP-631 for CAH continued to progress; as of February 1, 2023, BBP-631 has been generally well-tolerated in four patients treated at the first two dose levels.<\/li>\n<li>The Company plans to provide an update from patients treated at the third dose level by the end of 2023.<\/li>\n<li>CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases potentially addressable with adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy, with more than 75,000 cases estimated in the United States and European Union.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>RAS cancer portfolio:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>BridgeBio is continuing to progress the three main programs of its RAS franchise:\n<ul>\n<li>BBO-8520, an investigational, next-generation small molecule KRAS G12C dual inhibitor candidate that is designed to directly bind and inhibit KRAS G12C in both its active (GTP bound) and inactive (GDP bound) conformations, which remains on track to file an IND and enter the clinic in the second half of 2023.<\/li>\n<li>A PI3K\u03b1:RAS breaker program, investigational small molecules that are designed to block Ras-driven PI3K\u03b1 activation with a novel and potentially broad mechanism of action to target not only PI3K\u03b1 mutant tumors and RAS mutant tumors, but potentially other tumors driven by RTK activation of RAS signaling.

The net decrease of $321.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash (current) is primarily attributable to net cash used in operating activities of $419.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year 2022 was partially offset by a $90.0 million upfront payment received under the License, Development and Commercialization Agreement by and among the Company, its affiliate, Navire Pharma, Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS (the \u201cNavire-BMS License Agreement\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>During fiscal year 2022, the Company also received $110.0 million from the sale of its priority review voucher, $10.0 million upon closing of an asset purchase agreement between its affiliate, Origin Biosciences, Inc., and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. and $4.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock through an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering. The Company made a $20.5 million mandatory prepayment of a portion of its term loan obligations under its Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, in connection with the upfront payment received from BMS.<\/p>\n<p>As of December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s restricted cash (current) balance of $37.9 million primarily represents funds in a controlled account that was established in connection with the Second Amendment of the Company\u2019s Amended Loan and Security Agreement. The use of such non-interest-bearing cash is restricted per the terms of the underlying amended loan agreement and is to be used solely for certain research and development expenses directly attributable to the performance of obligations associated with the Navire-BMS License Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash (current), decreased by $92.3 million when compared to the balance as of September 30, 2022 of $558.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $93.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 which primarily contributed to the decline in the cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash (current) during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><br \/>\nOperating costs and expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 were $131.1 million and $589.9 million, respectively, as compared to $178.5 million and $646.3 million for the same periods in the prior year. The overall decrease in operating costs and expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the comparative periods was mainly due to overall decreases in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the Company&#8217;s reprioritization of its R&amp;D programs and company-wide streamlining of costs. The effects of the Company&#8217;s restructuring initiative that began in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 are now being realized due to reductions of operating costs and expenses. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three months and year ended December\u00a031, 2022 of $7.7 million and $43.8 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of winding down costs, exit and other related costs, impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, and severance and employee-related costs. The Company continues to evaluate its restructuring alternatives to drive operational changes in business processes, efficiencies, and cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We head into 2023 with cash on hand providing us with runway into 2024, and as we read out our key upcoming catalysts we expect to continue to allocate our capital carefully in order to preserve that runway and our optionality,&#8221; said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA, Chief Financial Officer of BridgeBio. &#8220;We will also continue to look for ways to extend our runway by considering potential royalty monetizations and partnerships.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Company\u2019s research and development and other expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented. While BridgeBio experienced some delays in certain of its clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, it continues to adapt with alternative site, telehealth and home visits, and at-home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with its contract manufacturing organizations. The longer-term impact, if any, of COVID-19 on BridgeBio\u2019s operating costs and expenses is currently unknown.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5837 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1684\" height=\"1376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_1.jpg 1684w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_1-300x245.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_1-1024x837.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_1-768x628.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_1-1536x1255.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1684px) 100vw, 1684px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5836 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1699\" height=\"1266\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_2.jpg 1699w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_2-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_2-1024x763.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_2-768x572.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_2-1536x1145.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1699px) 100vw, 1699px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5835 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1686\" height=\"1850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_3.jpg 1686w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_3-273x300.jpg 273w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_3-933x1024.jpg 933w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_3-768x843.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_3-1400x1536.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1686px) 100vw, 1686px\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5834 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1699\" height=\"931\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_4.jpg 1699w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_4-300x164.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_4-1024x561.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_4-768x421.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/BRIDGEBIO-PHARMA_final_Page_4-1536x842.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1699px) 100vw, 1699px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
