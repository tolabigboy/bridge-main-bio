(NASDAQ: BBIO) today announced ML Bio Solutions as a new subsidiary dedicated to developing BBP-418, a substrate supplementation therapy for the treatment of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2i (LGMD2i). BridgeBio is committing R&amp;D expertise to advance this small molecule oral therapy towards patients and intends to begin a natural history study in the second half of 2019, with interventional trials to initiate as soon as possible thereafter, subject to IND approval. The McColl Lockwood Laboratory for Muscular Dystrophy Research at Atrium Health will continue to support the program alongside BridgeBio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>LGMD2i is an autosomal recessive disease wherein loss-of-function mutations in the FKRP gene lead to decreased glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG). Properly-glycosylated \u03b1-DG anchors muscle cells to proteins outside of the cell in the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as shock absorber proteins inside of the muscle cells, such as dystrophin. In LGMD2i, \u03b1-DG has a defective sugar backbone, and thus cannot effectively bind these proteins to stabilize the muscle cell, leading to muscle cell fragility and damage under stress. Damaged and degenerating muscle cells can result in global loss of muscle strength. LGMD2i is a progressive and debilitating disease that affects an estimated 7,000 patients across the US and EU, with more affected globally. It is associated with loss of mobility and ultimately respiratory and cardiac failure, and there is presently no approved treatment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>ML Bio Solutions\u2019 compound BBP-418 aims to bypass the core metabolic defect in LGMD2i by providing a pro-drug [to the other enzymes in the pathway] that can be metabolized into the missing substrate in the \u03b1-DG sugar backbone. This therapeutic approach originates from the discovery and translational work of scientific co-founder Dr. Qi Long Lu, director of the McColl-Lockwood Laboratory for Muscular Dystrophy Research at Atrium Health, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-018-05990-z\">as published in a <em>Nature Communications<\/em> article in 2018.<\/a> A brief overview of the program can be found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/2cbf39b1-be9d-4639-8ecc-d7471daa70c6\">investor section of the BridgeBio website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cBy combining the scientific leadership of the McColl-Lockwood Laboratory with the rare disease development expertise at BridgeBio, we believe we can accelerate the path to making a safe and effective disease-modifying treatment available to LGMD2i patients as soon as possible,\u201d said Luther Lockwood, chairman of the board and President of ML Bio Solutions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cBBP-418 is a novel approach that targets LGMD2i at the source of disease, and exemplifies the BridgeBio mission of creating life-altering medicines by pairing well-understood genetically- driven phenotypes with treatments whose mechanisms target the sources of disease,\u201d said Uma Sinha, Ph.D, chief scientific officer of BridgeBio Pharma. \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with the foremost experts in the field to explore the translation of these important discoveries into clinical impact for patients who currently lack effective treatment options.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About ML Bio Solutions<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>ML Bio Solutions, a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma based in Charlotte, NC, is a biotechnology company focused on developing a small molecule as an oral substrate supplementation therapy for LGMD2i.
