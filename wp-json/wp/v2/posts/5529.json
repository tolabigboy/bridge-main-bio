(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced positive Phase 2b data of encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1). The results are featured in an oral presentation at the Endocrine Society (ENDO) 2022 Annual Conference in Atlanta, GA. BridgeBio will also host an investor call on June 13, 2022, at 4:30 pm ET to discuss the results from the Phase 2b study.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cADH1 is a rare genetic form of hypoparathyroidism associated with lifelong abnormally high urine calcium and low blood calcium levels, sometimes leading to severe consequences such as seizures, heart rhythm abnormalities, muscle cramping, and breathing difficulties,\u201d said Rachel Gafni, M.D., senior research physician and head of the Mineral Homeostasis Studies Group of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \u201cCurrent management with calcium and vitamin D supplements is inadequate and may exacerbate high urine calcium levels, which can cause kidney complications. These 24-week outpatient data, evaluating an investigational calcilytic in a precision-medicine approach, demonstrate that encaleret has the potential to restore normal calcium and phosphate metabolism in individuals with ADH1.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thirteen adults with ADH1 caused by nine unique <em>CASR<\/em> variants participated in the three-period, Phase 2b, open-label, dose-ranging study. Oral calcium and activated vitamin D supplements were discontinued prior to encaleret initiation. Periods 1 and 2 each evaluated encaleret over the course of five inpatient days and Period 3 included a 24-week outpatient evaluation. Key results from the Phase 2b study include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encaleret was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported; there were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals<\/li>\n<li>Key biochemical parameters of mineral homeostasis, summarized in the table below, were normalized by Period 2, Day 5 and were sustained through Period 3, Week 24 of the trial<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5534 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1356\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123.jpg 1356w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123-300x115.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123-1024x393.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Capture123-768x295.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1356px) 100vw, 1356px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor someone born with ADH1, the near-constant vigilance required to manage levels of calcium in the bloodstream is part of normal day-to-day life. The management helps to relieve the burden of health complications like seizures and hospitalizations, but in some cases, people still have symptoms even with astute maintenance of their condition. The possibility of a treatment option that could potentially alleviate the burden on patients and improve quality of life and health provides hope for people living with this genetic condition,\u201d said Michele Rayes, vice-chair of the board of directors of the HypoPARAthyroidism Association.<\/p>\n<p>The consistent and sustained results from all periods of this Phase 2b study support the potential for encaleret to establish a clinically meaningful efficacy, tolerability and safety profile as a potential treatment of adults with ADH1. The participants who completed Period 3 of the study were eligible to continue in an open label extension of up to 25 months. The planned Phase 3 registrational study in patients with ADH1 is designed as a randomized, open-label, two-arm study comparing the effect of encaleret to standard of care on blood and urine calcium for 24 weeks. BridgeBio plans to initiate the Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2022 with an expected readout of top line data at the end of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are eager to initiate our upcoming study and plan to build upon the knowledge and experience gained from the Phase 2b clinical trial. People with ADH1 are in serious need of treatment options, and we hope to reach them quickly with a meaningful therapy,\u201d said Mary Scott Roberts, M.D., senior director of clinical development at BridgeBio and clinical lead of the encaleret program.<\/p>\n<p>At ENDO 2022, BridgeBio also <a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/news\/bridgebio-pharma-to-present-phase-2b-data-and-pivotal-phase-3-study-design-of-encaleret-in-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia-type-1-adh1-at-the-endocrine-society-endo-2022-annual-conference\/\">shared<\/a> poster presentations on its achondroplasia program, including preclinical data on hypochondroplasia, as well as an ePoster about its congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Webcast Information<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the full Phase 2b data and pivotal study design for its Phase 3 trial for encaleret in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 on June 13, 2022\u00a0at\u00a04:30 pm ET.

Encaleret has received Fast Track Designation by the FDA and Orphan Drug status in the United States and European Union.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1)<\/strong><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong>ADH1 is caused by gain-of-function variants of\u00a0the <em>CASR <\/em>gene encoding the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) which are estimated to be carried by 12,000 individuals in the United States.<sup>1<\/sup>\u00a0The calcium-sensing receptor senses and regulates the level of extracellular calcium in the body through its activity in the parathyroid glands and the kidney. Due to increased sensitivity of the variant CaSR to extracellular calcium, patients with ADH1 have low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels, and excess urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria). Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular symptoms, which can include severe muscle cramping and seizures, while hypercalciuria can lead to kidney calcifications and impaired kidney function.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
