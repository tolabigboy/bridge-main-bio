CAN<em>inform<\/em>\u00a0is an ongoing natural history study of more than 60 patients with Canavan disease, which was designed as a robust comparator for the CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u00a0study in accordance with FDA\u2019s guidance on the design and conduct of externally controlled trials. Highlights of the results presented at ESGCT 2024 include:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Rapid and sustained reduction of NAA in urine and brain of participants post BBP-812 dosing\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Urine NAA was reduced to levels associated with mild Canavan disease (average reduction of 64% +\/- 14% twelve months after receiving low dose and 73% +\/- 13% three months after the high dose)<\/li>\n<li>NAA in CSF was reduced an average of 70% +\/- 10% twelve months after receiving the low dose. Lower urine NAA levels have been maintained for nearly 3 years in the earliest dosed participants<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Improved myelination on T-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) observed in the majority of participants dosed with BBP-812<\/li>\n<li>Progressive and continued post-dose improvement in gross motor function (measured by Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)-88) and achievement of motor milestones (measured by Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE)-2)\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>This trajectory of progressive improvement stands in stark contrast to the characterized natural history of the disease, where the trajectory over this time period is essentially flat<\/li>\n<li>In the low-dose cohort, these divergent trajectories result in statistically significant improvements in achieved motor function and milestones at 12-months after treatment with BBP-812, compared to what is observed in and predicted by the natural history of the disease; data from the high dose cohort are not yet available<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>All participants demonstrated progress on administered developmental\/motor assessments as measured by the GMFM-88, HINE-2, CDC milestones, or the Canavan Disease Rating Scale<\/li>\n<li>BBP-812 continues to be generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with other systemically administered AAV9 gene therapies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BBP-812 has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease (RPDD), and Fast Track Designations from the FDA, as well as Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency. With RPDD, if approved, BridgeBio may qualify for a PRV.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About CANaspire<\/strong><br \/>\nCANaspire is a Phase 1\/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic activity of BridgeBio\u2019s AAV9 gene therapy candidate, BBP-812, in pediatric patients with Canavan disease. Each eligible patient will receive a single IV infusion of BBP-812. The primary outcomes of the study are safety, as well as change from baseline of urine and central nervous system NAA levels. Motor function and development will also be assessed.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the CANaspire trial, visit\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.treatcanavan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">TreatCanavan.com<\/a>\u00a0or ClinicalTrials.gov (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/study\/NCT04998396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">NCT04998396<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Canavan Disease<\/strong><br \/>\nAffecting approximately 1,000 children in the U.S. and European Union, Canavan disease is an ultra-rare, disabling and fatal disease with no approved therapy. Most children are not able to meet developmental milestones, are unable to crawl, walk, sit or talk, and die at a young age. The disease is caused by an inherited mutation of the\u00a0<em>ASPA<\/em>\u00a0gene that codes for aspartoacylase, a protein that breaks down a compound called NAA. Deficiency of aspartoacylase activity results in accumulation of NAA, and ultimately results in toxicity to myelin in ways that are not currently well understood. Myelin insulates neuronal axons, and without it, neurons are unable to send and receive messages as they should. The current standard of care for Canavan disease is limited to supportive therapy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
