(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio or the Company), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced that it has executed a definitive credit facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders for up to $750.0 million in financing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This facility, combined with the Company\u2019s existing cash balance as of September 30, 2021, provides access to over $1.2 billion to advance the Company\u2019s pipeline programs, support commercialization efforts, and enable the Company to pursue strategic business development opportunities. As structured, this financing is expected to fully fund BridgeBio\u2019s portfolio of more than 30 drug development and discovery programs into 2024, independent of near-term milestone readouts. It is a significant achievement in BridgeBio\u2019s broader efforts to attract diverse sources of capital to fund life science innovation and is aligned with its long-term strategy of creating non-dilutive financing pathways that leverage portfolio readouts &#8211; in addition to cash balance on hand &#8211; to extend runway.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This financing announcement follows BridgeBio\u2019s repurchase of approximately $150.0 million in its own common stock under its 2021 Share Repurchase Program, completing about $385.6 million of equity and capped call purchases in the aggregate since its initial public offering in 2019. In addition, today\u2019s financing replaces the Company\u2019s $100.0 million debt facility with Hercules. Collectively, these transactions represent a strategic recapitalization of the Company ahead of upcoming clinical data readouts.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are grateful to have the support of debt investors who are committed to helping us build the next great\u00a0genetic medicine company and deliver meaningful therapies for patients in need. Since our founding, we have believed in the power and importance of innovative financing approaches to advance critical biomedical research and drug development, and we are grateful that our broad diversified pipeline enables us to do this. By bringing on this additional capital, we have the potential to help more people living with genetic diseases and cancers as quickly as possible,\u201d said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA, BridgeBio\u2019s chief financial officer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cPotential breakthrough medicines should never languish on the shelf because of a lack of funding. By seizing inventive financing tools to fund its growing R&amp;D pipeline, BridgeBio is working to ensure that promising medicines in development can advance into the clinic and toward potential commercial approval. The Company\u2019s groundbreaking approach to science and finance has made it a leader within the biotech industry and we are hopeful there are new methods we can explore to more fully unlock the power of investors to help patients,\u201d said Andrew Lo, Ph.D., a BridgeBio co-founder and a member of the Company\u2019s board of directors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Key features of the credit facility include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>$450.0 million funded on November 17, 2021<\/li>\r\n<li>An additional $300.0 million to be funded at the Company\u2019s option following either 1) positive topline results from Part A of its Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM trial of TTR stabilizer for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), which is expected by the end of the year, OR 2) positive proof-of-concept data for various pipeline programs by year end 2022, with $100.0 million available upon each proof-of-concept, for up to three pipeline programs<\/li>\r\n<li>Fixed interest rate of 9%, with 3% eligible at the Company\u2019s discretion to be paid in kind and added to principal<\/li>\r\n<li>Maturity date of November 17, 2026<\/li>\r\n<li>Interest-only period for three years, which may be extended to four years upon success of the Part A readout<\/li>\r\n<li>Substantial flexibility for future business development, M&amp;A, share repurchases, and royalty transactions<\/li>\r\n<li>No financial covenants<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
