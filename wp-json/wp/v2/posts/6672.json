The data demonstrate that targeting near-complete TTR stabilization with acoramidis may enable cardiac remodeling and functional recovery in patients with ATTR-CM.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Encaleret \u2013 Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) inhibitor for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1):<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>CALIBRATE, the Phase 3 clinical trial of encaleret in ADH1, continues to enroll; the Company anticipates sharing topline data from CALIBRATE in 2025.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>BBP-418 \u2013 Glycosylation substrate for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I\/R9 (LGMD2I\/R9):<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>BridgeBio has surpassed its interim analysis enrollment target for its Phase 3 FORTIFY study of BBP-418 in individuals living with LGMD2I\/R9, with top-line results from the interim analysis expected in 2025.<\/li>\n<li>Recent Type C interactions with U.S. FDA focused on the validated glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1DG) bioassay and our interim analysis plans reinforce BridgeBio\u2019s belief that there is potential to pursue Accelerated Approval for BBP-418.<\/li>\n<li>Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for BBP-418 highlights that LGMD2I\/R9 is a rare disease with serious manifestations, which primarily impacts children. If BBP-418 is approved, BridgeBio may qualify for a Priority Review Voucher, which can be applied to another therapy in the Company\u2019s pipeline for a shorter timeline during the review process of a NDA or can be sold to another company looking to receive priority review for one of its applications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-dose infigratinib \u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia:<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>BridgeBio shared data from Month 12 and 18 for Cohort 5 of PROPEL 2 (0.25 mg\/kg\/day), its Phase 2 trial in achondroplasia with the oral treatment, infigratinib, with results including:\n<ul type=\"square\">\n<li>A statistically significant and sustained increase in AHV, with a mean change from baseline of +2.51cm\/yr at Month 12, and +2.50 cm\/yr at Month 18 (p=0.0015).<\/li>\n<li>At Month 18, there was a statistically significant improvement in body proportionality (p-value of 0.001).
