Infigratinib is an investigational oral small molecule designed to inhibit FGFR3 signaling and target achondroplasia at its source. These data, which were also presented today at the 62nd Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting in Liverpool, demonstrate continued potential best-in-class efficacy and an encouraging safety profile as a first-in-class oral treatment option.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPublication of results from PROPEL 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine and Breakthrough Therapy Designation of infigratinib by the FDA underscore the significance and importance of these data and the potential of this oral therapy to not only increase height, but more importantly, enhance functionality for children with achondroplasia,\u201d said Ravi Savarirayan, M.D., Ph.D., of Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the global lead investigator for PROPEL 2 and lead author of the NEJM publication.<\/p>\n<p>Key results from the PROPEL 2 dataset were presented today at ESPE in a talk titled \u201c<em>Oral infigratinib for children with achondroplasia: Month 18 results from the PROPEL 2 study demonstrate safety and durability of treatment effect on linear growth with improved body proportionality\u201d<\/em>\u00a0by Melita Irving, M.D., a clinical geneticist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK and investigator for the infigratinib clinical program at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital. The key data that were shared included:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"square\">\n<li>Statistically significant increase in annualized height velocity (AHV) was observed in children in Cohort 5 who received a daily dose of 0.25 mg\/kg\/ day of infigratinib), with a mean change from baseline in AHV of +2.50 cm\/year (P=0.001) at Month 18<\/li>\n<li>Mean change from baseline in height Z-score was +0.54 (P&lt;0.001) relative to an untreated achondroplasia population at Month 18<\/li>\n<li>Statistically significant improvement in body proportionality (mean upper to lower body segment ratio) was -0.12 (P=0.001) at Month 18<\/li>\n<li>Oral infigratinib was well tolerated at Month 18, with no serious adverse events (SAE) or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to treatment discontinuation\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Additionally, there was no accelerated progression of bone age, negative changes in bone mineral density, or other bone-related adverse events observed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cWe are encouraged to see no safety signals and no adverse changes in bone age or bone mineral density,\u201d said Dr. Irving. \u201cThese results point to the potential of infigratinib for children living with skeletal dysplasia, and we look forward to further evaluation of infigratinib in PROPEL 3, the ongoing Phase 3 trial, as well as in the Phase 2 portion of the ACCEL program in children with hypochondroplasia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Infigratinib has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the shared results from the PROPEL 2 clinical trial, which meet the FDA\u2019s requirement of potentially demonstrating substantial improvement in efficacy over available therapies on clinically significant endpoints. In addition to receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, infigratinib has also received Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for achondroplasia from the FDA.

Achondroplasia impacts overall health and quality of life, leading to medical complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. The condition is uniformly caused by an activating variant in FGFR3.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a new type of biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases.
