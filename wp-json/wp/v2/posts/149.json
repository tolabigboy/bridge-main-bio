Over-activity of this pathway, often driven by distinct gene mutations, causes or contributes to many human cancers. Inhibiting\u00a0SHP2offers a new approach to treat tumors relying on this pathway.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Shafique Virani, M.D., joins BridgeBio as CEO in residence, and will serve as CEO of Navire. Virani was most recently officer and vice president of business development, licensing and M&amp;A at Roche\/Genentech where he assumed several leadership roles across the globe over 13 years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Navire&#8217;s compounds potently bind\u00a0SHP2\u00a0and prevent activation of the protein, blocking its ability to promote tumor growth,&#8221; said Virani. &#8220;Directly inhibiting\u00a0SHP2\u00a0could provide patients and physicians a new, transformative approach to treat RTK-driven cancers at their source.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Navire Pharma&#8217;s lead compounds were discovered and developed by the IACS team led by\u00a0Phil Jones, Ph.D., executive director and head of drug discovery at IACS, together with\u00a0Benjamin G. Neel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at\u00a0New York University(NYU).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Resistance mechanisms that cause many patients to stop responding to therapy rely on\u00a0SHP2activity,&#8221; said Jones, a scientific co-founder of Navire. &#8220;Our &#8216;molecular glue&#8217; inhibitory approach inactivates\u00a0SHP2\u00a0and could help overcome these resistance pathways.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SHP2\u00a0also suppresses T-cell activity against growing tumors through regulation of the adaptive immune response by binding to PD-1 and dephosphorylating CD28 and the protein LCK.\u00a0SHP2inhibition may relieve this negative effect, enhancing the patient&#8217;s immune response to fight cancer proliferation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;SHP2&#8217;s role in oncogenic signaling has been known for decades, but effective approaches for inhibiting the protein were only recently discovered,&#8221; said Neel, Navire scientific co-founder and chairman of the company&#8217;s scientific advisory board. &#8220;These novel approaches have demonstrated compelling efficacy in pre-clinical disease models, which we hope will translate into benefit for patients.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Other members of Navire&#8217;s scientific advisory board, comprised of leaders in cell signaling and hematological and solid tumors, include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Kwok Kin-Wong, M.D., Ph.D., chief of Hematology and Medical Oncology,\u00a0NYU<\/li>\r\n<li>Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor, Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, MD Anderson<\/li>\r\n<li>Frank McCormick, Ph.D., director of the\u00a0University of California, San Francisco\u00a0(UCSF) Cancer Center and associate dean of the UCSF School of Medicine, and co-founder, Onyx Pharmaceuticals<\/li>\r\n<li>Lillian Siu, M.D., professor of Medicine, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,\u00a0Toronto<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio also has added pharmaceutical and biotechnology executives to the Navire team, including Uma Sinha, Ph.D., and\u00a0Brian Metcalf, Ph.D., who together have advanced more than 30 drug candidates into human trials, and have brought nine safe and effective drug products to market. The BridgeBio team will closely collaborate with MD Anderson through IND filing and prosecute subsequent clinical trials.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Navire combines MD Anderson&#8217;s clinicians and drug development scientists with our veteran biotechnology team to create a focused organization to develop\u00a0SHP2-targeted therapies,&#8221; said\u00a0Neil Kumar, Ph.D., chief executive officer of BridgeBio Pharma. &#8220;Together, we aim to bring these novel treatments to patients at the soonest possible opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Navire Pharmaceuticals<\/strong><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/navirepharma.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Navire Pharma<\/a>, a subsidiary of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BridgeBio Pharma<\/a>, and in collaboration with the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at MD Anderson, is developing inhibitors of\u00a0SHP2\u00a0as targeted therapeutics for the treatment of multiple cancers.
