(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced positive feedback from the U.S. FDA and the EU EMA on key elements of the trial design for PROPEL3, its pivotal Phase 3 study of infigratinib in children with achondroplasia. Both regulatory bodies indicated that a single, one-year, 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial would be acceptable as a registrational study for approval, which clears the path for initiation of the trial by the end of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>\u201dThe regulatory feedback clearing the path to approval for infigratinib is great news for children living with achondroplasia and for physicians who treat them. It is incredibly exciting that infigratinib has the potential to become the first effective oral treatment option to improve growth, enhance functionality and decrease complications,\u201d said Dr. Melita Irving, M.D., a clinical geneticist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK and investigator for the infigratinib clinical program at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">PROPEL3, the Phase 3 registrational study is a randomized, double-blinded, multi-site, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of infigratinib in children with achondroplasia aged 3 to 18 years with open growth plates. The primary endpoint will be change from baseline in AHV, with secondary endpoints including proportionality, height Z-score, and impact on medical complications. BridgeBio is also committed to exploring the potential of infigratinib on the wider medical and functional impacts of achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias, which hold significant unmet needs for families. Based on the positive results to date, the Company has been enrolling children in the run-in for PROPEL3 and expects to initiate PROPEL3 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Cohort 5 of PROPEL2, BridgeBio\u2019s Phase 2 dose-finding study, demonstrated that the dose level of 0.25 mg\/kg\/day resulted in a significant and robust increase in AHV, with a mean change of +3.38 cm\/year from baseline at 6 months. The findings also highlighted early but promising trends towards improvement in proportionality, as measured by the upper and lower body segment ratio study. Additionally, the study has shown a well-tolerated safety profile, with no study drug related treatment emergent adverse events, SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs at the selected dose.<\/p>\n<p>\u201dWe are thrilled to have regulatory alignment on key elements of our Phase 3 trial design and the path towards submitting a marketing application to both the FDA and the EMA. We are appreciative of the support from both agencies and plan to move forward swiftly with initiation and dosing in the pivotal trial, with the hopes of providing a much needed oral option to children with achondroplasia,\u201d said Adora Ndu, Pharm.D., J.D., chief regulatory officer of BridgeBio.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, BridgeBio expects to initiate clinical development for infigratinib in hypochondroplasia, a skeletal dysplasia closely related to achondroplasia and similarly driven by FGFR3 gain-of-function variants. BridgeBio has previously presented promising preclinical data for hypochondroplasia at ENDO 2023 and ASHG 2022.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Achondroplasia<\/strong><br \/>\nAchondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature, affecting approximately 55,000 people in the\u00a0U.S. and EU, including up to 10,000 children and adolescents with open growth plates. Achondroplasia impacts overall health and quality of life, leading to medical complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. The condition is uniformly caused by an activating mutation in FGFR3.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
