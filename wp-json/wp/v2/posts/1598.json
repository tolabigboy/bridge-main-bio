Vector copy number and transgene mRNA expression in the adrenal glands were analyzed at 4 and 12 weeks post-dosing in the low- and medium-dose arms and at 12 and 24 weeks post-dosing in the high-dose arm. No dose-related adverse events were observed at any of the doses tested at any time point.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, treatment with BBP-631 resulted in high vector copy number (VCN) and mRNA expression in the adrenal gland, suggesting strong tropism and uptake of BBP-631 for the adrenal gland. In the high-dose arm, VCNs were maintained between 12 and 24 weeks. Furthermore, mRNA levels increased between 4 and 12 weeks for the medium dose arm and were consistent between 12 and 24 weeks for the high dose arm. Researchers also saw dose-dependent increases in both VCNs and mRNA levels across the three doses tested.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDurable expression of a vector in adrenal tissue has presented challenges for the development of gene therapies for adrenal indications,\u201d said Clayton Beard, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research and Development at BridgeBio Gene Therapy. \u201cThe observed maintenance of the BBP-631 AAV5 vector for as long as 24 weeks in NHPs represents an important step in validating a gene therapy approach to treat 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and we anticipate filing our IND for this indication in 2020.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Canavan Disease Experimental Therapy Amenable to IV Delivery<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In a poster entitled \u201cA Route of Administration Study of BBP-812, an AAV9-based Gene Therapy for the Treatment of Canavan Disease, in Juvenile Cynomolgus Macaques,\u201d scientists from Aspa Therapeutics examine the uptake of and resulting DNA and mRNA expression for BBP-812, an experimental AAV9 vector, in three different administration routes: intravenous (IV), intrathecal (IT) or intracerebroventricular (ICV). Biodistribution of vector genomes and of transgene mRNA was evaluated throughout the central nervous system (CNS) at both 3 and 8 weeks post-administration. No dose-related adverse events were observed at any tested doses at either time period.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Using an IV route of administration, vector copy number and mRNA expression were not only detected broadly throughout the brain and spinal cord, but were generally detected at levels higher than when administered ICV or IT.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDeveloping therapies for diseases like Canavan presents particular delivery challenges &#8211; namely getting the therapy into the central nervous system,\u201d said Adam Shaywitz, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at BridgeBio Gene Therapy. \u201cIn this preclinical study, we observed that broad CNS delivery of our vector is possible using an IV route, which is far less invasive than the IT or ICV routes and therefore points to IV as the preferred route of administration in our clinical program for Canavan disease.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aspa Therapeutics is currently enrolling a natural history study of Canavan disease called CAN<em>inform<\/em>.

People with CAH have an impaired ability to produce the hormone cortisol, which can result in life-threatening adrenal crises and significant morbidity throughout life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Aspa Therapeutics<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aspa Therapeutics is a BridgeBio Pharma subsidiary focused on developing a gene therapy to treat Canavan disease, an extremely rare genetic disease caused by an inherited mutation of the ASPA gene wherein children affected experience lack of head control, lack of muscle tone (often resulting in floppiness or spasticity) and seizures. Most children are not able to meet developmental milestones, are unable to crawl, walk, sit or talk, and pass away at a young age.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About\u00a0BridgeBio Pharma<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
