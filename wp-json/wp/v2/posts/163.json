In addition, the company announced that it has nominated the development candidate molecule and will commence IND-enabling studies. Finally, CoA announced the formation of a scientific advisory board that will help guide future development.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PKAN is a neurological disorder that arises from mutations in the human\u00a0<em>PANK2<\/em>\u00a0gene, which codes for an enzyme called pantothenate kinase 2 (PanK2). The mutations\u00a0lead to progressive difficulty with movement, speech and vision, usually beginning in childhood. There are currently no treatments approved for PKAN, which typically results in death in early adulthood.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The study, authored by St. Jude researcher\u00a0Suzanne Jackowski, Ph.D., describes the discovery of a new class of compounds, the pantazines, that are designed to allosterically modulate pantothenate kinases, allowing PanK enzymes to make more CoA than they would typically make in an untreated system. The specific tool compound used in the study, PZ-2891, was found to be orally bioavailable and cross the blood brain barrier, a critical characteristic for treating neurological disorders like PKAN. In addition, in a mouse model of brain CoA deficiency, animals on PZ-2891 therapy gained weight, had improved locomotor activity and a longer life span, suggesting the compound could be a novel treatment approach for PKAN. For her role in advancing research in the field, Dr. Jackowski was awarded the Lippman Medal from the International Association for Cellular Coenzymes in\u00a0July 2018.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Dr. Jackowski&#8217;s novel approach to modulating PanK enzymes is the scientific foundation of CoA Therapeutics. In this study, we see the potential of novel allosteric modulators of PanK in increasing brain CoA levels resulting in phenotypic correction in knock-out mice. These compounds have been designed to be highly brain penetrating which is critical for diseases primarily affecting the brain such as PKAN,&#8221; said\u00a0Shafique Virani, M.D., chief executive officer for CoA Therapeutics. &#8220;We will be moving rapidly to translate this exciting science to support entry of this therapeutic approach into clinical trials in PKAN and other diseases of CoA sequestration.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Jackowski, who is a member of the faculty of St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, will be joining CoA&#8217;s scientific advisory board.
