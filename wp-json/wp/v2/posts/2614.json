(Nasdaq: BBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, today reported its financial results for the second quarter ending June 30, 2020 and provided an update on the company\u2019s operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of 2020, BridgeBio has initiated four company-sponsored clinical trials, progressed its additional 11 ongoing clinical trials, submitted three Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and completed the rolling submission of its first New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA. During the quarter, BridgeBio strengthened its corporate governance by adding three world-class independent directors to its board. In addition, it recently entered into a partnership with Perceptive Advisors-founded company LianBio, expanding BridgeBio\u2019s global reach into China.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio remains on track with each of its four core value drivers &#8211; acoramidis (formerly AG10, TTR stabilizer) for ATTR cardiomyopathy, low-dose infigratinib (FGFRi) for achondroplasia, AAV5 gene therapy for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and encaleret (CaSRi) for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) &#8211;\u00a0 and the company believes it is adequately financed through key readouts for each of these programs. Notably, BridgeBio dosed the first child in its Phase 2 clinical trial of infigratinib in achondroplasia in July.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The strategic collaboration with LianBio will initially focus on targeted oncology. BridgeBio\u2019s near-term economics includes a total of $26.5 million in upfront and milestone payments. BridgeBio will additionally receive up to $505 million in future milestone payments, tiered royalty payments ranging from single- to double-digits and increase its equity interest via investment in LianBio. BridgeBio CEO Neil Kumar has also been appointed to the LianBio board of directors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Across the company, BridgeBio\u2019s drug engineering platform continues to deliver. Strengthening its ability to discover new targets, it established collaboration agreements with Johns Hopkins University and University of Florida and continues to assess a wide variety of new programs in the genetic disease space. BridgeBio\u2019s pre-clinical platform has expanded to include additional modalities such as antisense oligonucleotides and deepened expertise in critical areas such as molecular modeling and novel statistical approaches to genetics. Its clinical platform has grown and now encompasses more than 350 trial sites in over 25 countries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cOn a risk-adjusted basis we are in a great position to produce meaningful medicines for patients and meaningful returns to investors over the next 18 to 24 months. This is exemplified by our disease-modifying, first or best-in-class therapeutic candidates for ATTR, achondroplasia, ADH1, and CAH. We intend to deliver on this goal by expanding our industry-leading target identification and research engine and global clinical development infrastructure, and look forward to delivering our medicines, once approved, to patients through our growing commercial organization,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder Neil Kumar, Ph.D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent pipeline progress and corporate updates:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Low-dose infigratinib\u00a0\u2013 Selective FGFR inhibitor for achondroplasia:\u00a0<\/strong>Dosed first child in the Phase 2 clinical program\u00a0(PROPEL 2) (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04265651\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NCT04265651<\/a>).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>BBP-418 <\/strong>\u2013 <strong>Glycosylation substrate pro-drug for LGMD2i: <\/strong>Dosed first subject in Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Expansion into China through partnership with LianBio: <\/strong>BridgeBio entered into a strategic collaboration with Perceptive Advisors-founded LianBio, expanding its reach into China and other major Asian markets.

The increases in operating expenses of $55.2 million and $94.0 million during the periods were attributable to the increase in external-related costs and increase in headcount to support the progression in our research and development programs, including our increasing research pipelines, and overall growth of our operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our research and development expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global outbreak of COVID-19 for the periods presented.
