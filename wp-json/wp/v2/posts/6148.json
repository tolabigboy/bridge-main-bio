(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced that the first child has been dosed in PROPEL 3, a Phase 3 clinical trial studying the efficacy and safety of infigratinib in children with achondroplasia. Both the U.S. FDA and the EU EMA indicated the trial design for PROPEL 3 would be acceptable as a registrational study to support a marketing application for the treatment of children with achondroplasia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Phase 2 data for infigratinib has been very promising and suggests potential to increase growth, improve functionality and reduce the associated medical complications in children with achondroplasia. With the recent dosing of the first child in the Phase 3 trial, I am hopeful that we are one step closer to providing a safe, effective oral therapy to the people in the achondroplasia community who are seeking treatment,\u201d said Dr. Ravi Savarirayan, M.D., Ph.D., clinical geneticist and leader of the molecular therapies research group at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia and the global lead investigator for PROPEL 3.<\/p>\n<p>PROPEL 3 is a global, one-year, 2:1 randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of infigratinib in children with achondroplasia aged 3 to &lt;18 years with open growth plates. The primary endpoint will be change from baseline in AHV, with secondary endpoints including proportionality, height Z-score (a measure of variance and dispersion from the average height of children with achondroplasia), and impact on medical complications and quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled about this major milestone for our program and are hopeful about what this means for those families seeking a therapeutic option. We are grateful to the children and their families for participating in our Phase 3 trial as well as the open collaboration we have built with physicians and advocacy groups to best understand the needs of those living with this condition. We look forward to continuing to explore the benefits of infigratinib not only in growth, but in the functional improvements and the alleviation of medical complications that are most meaningful to the community,\u201d said Daniela Rogoff, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president of clinical development for skeletal dysplasias at BridgeBio.<\/p>\n<p>In June 2023, the Company presented updated six-month results from Cohort 5 of PROPEL 2, its Phase 2 dose-finding study, at ENDO 2023. Cohort 5 demonstrated that the dose level of 0.25 mg\/kg\/day resulted in a significant and robust increase in AHV, with a mean change of +3.38 cm\/year from baseline at six months. The findings also highlighted early but promising trends towards improvement in proportionality, as measured by the upper and lower body segment ratio. Additionally, the results showed a well-tolerated safety profile, with no study drug related treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events at the 0.25 mg\/kg dose.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAchondroplasia can impact the overall health and wellbeing of a person, including functional limitations, social stigma and medical complications. We appreciate the opportunity to work with BridgeBio to ensure the needs of our community are heard, and we are excited by what the Phase 3 study could bring for those looking for options to help themselves or their loved ones,\u201d said Susana Noval, director of Fundaci\u00f3n ALPE Acondroplasia. Fundaci\u00f3n ALPE Acondroplasia, based in Gij\u00f3n, Spain, is an advocacy organization for people with achondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias and their families.<\/p>\n<p>Information about PROPEL 3 (NCT06164951) can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/study\/NCT06164951?cond=achondroplasia%20infigratinib&amp;term=NCT06164951&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>\u00a0on clinicaltrials.gov.

Additionally, BridgeBio expects to initiate ACCEL, an observational lead-in study for infigratinib in hypochondroplasia, a skeletal dysplasia closely related to achondroplasia and similarly driven by FGFR3 gain-of-function variants, in the first half of 2024. BridgeBio has previously presented promising preclinical data for hypochondroplasia at ENDO 2023 and ASHG 2022. BridgeBio is committed to exploring the potential of infigratinib on wider medical and functional impacts of achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias, which hold significant unmet needs for families.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Achondroplasia<\/strong><br \/>\nAchondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature, affecting approximately 55,000 people in the\u00a0U.S. and EU, including up to 10,000 children and adolescents with open growth plates. Achondroplasia impacts overall health and quality of life, leading to medical complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. The condition is uniformly caused by an activating mutation in FGFR3.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
