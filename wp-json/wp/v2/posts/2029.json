(Nasdaq: BBIO) affiliate company QED Therapeutics announced today that patients have been dosed in separate Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials of infigratinib in cancer indications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 3 PROOF 302 trial sponsored by QED is studying infigratinib for the adjuvant (post-surgery) treatment of invasive urothelial carcinoma. A second, investigator-initiated trial, led by Sameek Roychowdhury, M.D., Ph.D., of The Ohio State University (OSU) Comprehensive Cancer Center, is studying infigratinib for the treatment of advanced and metastatic solid tumors with confirmed FGFR gene fusions\/translocations or other FGFR alterations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the PROOF 302 trial, investigators are enrolling subjects with invasive urothelial cancer harboring susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations who are at high risk of recurrence following surgical resection. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive once daily oral infigratinib or placebo. The primary outcome is disease-free survival, and secondary outcomes include metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and safety and tolerability measures.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cMany patients with invasive urothelial carcinoma will have their cancer recur within two years after surgery,\u201d said PROOF 302 trial lead Sumanta Pal, M.D., professor of medical oncology and therapeutics research at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. \u201cCorrespondingly, I believe there are many patients who could benefit from an oral, post-surgery treatment option that targets FGFR3 alterations, the genetic driver of many urothelial carcinomas.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 2 study at OSU and selected sites within the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN)\u00a0will evaluate the efficacy of infigratinib in patients who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are positive for FGFR1-3 gene fusions\/translocations or other FGFR alterations. The open-label study will assess overall response rate as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include progression-free survival, best overall response, disease control rate, overall survival and measures of safety and tolerability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cIncreasingly, oncologists are learning to classify their patients\u2019 cancers based on genetic mutations, going beyond the origin of the tumor,\u201d noted Dr. Roychowdhury. \u201cGiven the activity we have seen with infigratinib in FGFR2-fusion-driven bile duct cancers and FGFR3-altered urothelial carcinoma, our hope is that infigratinib will demonstrate similar activity in additional cancers that appear to be driven by alterations in FGFR. There appear to be multiple FGFR alterations that can drive cancer growth\u2014and we hope to see these patients benefit too.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For additional information on the PROOF 302 trial, including eligibility, patients should ask their physician, visit clinicaltrials.gov, or email PROOF302@QEDtx.com.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For additional information on the Phase 2 trial in metastatic solid tumors with FGFR gene alterations, including eligibility, patients should ask their physician, visit clinicaltrials.gov, or email OSUCCCClinicaltrials@osumc.edu.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About QED Therapeutics <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>QED Therapeutics, an affiliate of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine for FGFR-driven diseases. Our lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown activity that we believe to be meaningful in clinical measures, such as overall response rate, in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED intends to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for second and later-line cholangiocarcinoma in 2020. QED Therapeutics is also evaluating infigratinib in preclinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia. We plan to conduct further clinical trials to evaluate the potential for infigratinib to treat patients with other FGFR-driven tumor types and rare disorders.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on QED Therapeutics, please visit the company\u2019s website at qedtx.com.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
