The two entities signed a preliminary, non-binding Collaboration Agreement establishing a mutual intention to work together on project \u2018NADER\u2019 (<u>N<\/u>eeds\u00a0<u>A<\/u>ssessment and Therapeutics\u00a0<u>De<\/u>velopment for\u00a0<u>R<\/u>are Diseases \u2013 \u2018nader\u2019 meaning \u2018rare\u2019 in Arabic). Genetic in origin, these often life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases affect a small percentage of the population and are present throughout the person&#8217;s entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. The partnership will launch operations in Abu Dhabi to conduct clinical trials and research, leveraging the Emirate\u2019s advanced infrastructure for innovation and life science.<\/p>\n<p>Project \u2018NADER\u2019 aims to revolutionize the field of early diagnosis and treatment in order to potentially improve patient outcomes. The entities intend to collaborate on identifying patients with several rare diseases, including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, FGFR-driven craniosynostoses, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Canavan disease, propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and others as mutually agreed. Even though these rare diseases affect a small percentage of the population and can present with nonspecific signs and symptoms, they are often misdiagnosed or only diagnosed later in the disease course after severe complications manifest. Accurate and early diagnosis are crucial to starting intervention promptly and avoiding disease progression. The project will also allow identification of patients who have already been diagnosed but do not currently have access to cutting edge therapies or clinical trial options.<\/p>\n<p>In the first phase of project \u2018NADER\u2019, the two entities intend to utilize innovative risk assessment algorithms that will be deployed through the healthcare provider\u2019s secure internal data to identify patients at risk for specific rare diseases. Expectations for future phases of the project include analyses of vast amounts of data to identify patterns and markers associated with the diseases and generate personalized risk scores for patients, followed by genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of identified potential patients. The project also aims to run awareness campaigns and education activities about such rare diseases, to further support the mapping activity and encourage local collaborations from other healthcare providers. Burjeel Holdings will deploy the project across its widespread hospitals and medical centers across the UAE as part of routine diagnostic care, with plans to expand the project through its growing healthcare infrastructure in the region. Local partnerships will also be sought to facilitate wider implementation.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking on the partnership\u2019s potential to transform the way rare diseases are identified, Mr. John Sunil, CEO of Burjeel Holdings, said, \u201cProject \u2018NADER\u2019 marks a significant milestone in our commitment to delivering the best possible care to our patients. It brings together Burjeel\u2019s expertise in healthcare delivery and outreach and BridgeBio\u2019s vast expertise in delivering breakthrough therapies for rare diseases. By combining our strengths, we seek to address the challenges faced in identification of rare diseases, which often go undiagnosed until symptoms become severe. The project will enable early interventions whether in the form of established treatments or novel therapies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the project launch, Dr. Asma Ibrahim Al Mannaei, Executive Director of the Research, and Innovation Center at the Department of Health \u2013 Abu Dhabi (DoH), said: \u201cAs part of our ongoing efforts to advance early diagnosis and treatment, the Department of Health \u2013 Abu Dhabi is proud to witness yet another leading partnership aimed at propelling transformative medicine to safeguard the health and well-being of community members. Reinforcing Abu Dhabi\u2019s position as a leading destination for life science and innovation, we remain committed to empowering healthcare providers in the Emirate with the means to lead research studies and conduct clinical trials to map out a path towards discovery and breakthrough healthcare in the Emirate and beyond. Similar initiatives translate the Department\u2019s vision in securing health for all while accelerating healthcare outcomes for the benefit of the global community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first phase will aim to set the roadmap to providing novel treatment options for identified patients through clinical trials. Dr. Khaled Musallam, Group Chief Research Officer of Burjeel Holdings and project lead said, \u201cMany rare diseases are highly clustered in our region due to our unique genetic pool. These diseases are often \u2018lost in the system\u2019 or have very limited treatment options. Our ultimate goal from project \u2018NADER\u2019 is to link patients to evolving treatment options through clinical trials of small molecules and gene therapies. The first step to bringing such innovative solutions to our region is to identify disease burden and patients\u2019 unmet needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuilding on our already established foundation of genetic disease patient care, we hope that BridgeBio can help bring more patients access to novel treatments, clinical trials, and capabilities alongside a strong partner like Burjeel, and so we are grateful to be working with them to expand our efforts in the MENA region. The BridgeBio vision is to serve patients around the world, and this is an important step in that direction,\u201d said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., BridgeBio founder and CEO.<\/p>\n<p>As the collaboration unfolds, both Burjeel Holdings and BridgeBio anticipate significant progress in the field of rare diseases in the region. The project could also provide patients in the region with increased access to BridgeBio\u2019s state-of-the-art pharmacologic and gene therapies that are currently in development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Burjeel Holdings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2007, Burjeel Holdings is one of the leading private healthcare services providers in the MENA region.
