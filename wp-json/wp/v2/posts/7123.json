(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio or the Company), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Attruby\u2122 (acoramidis), an orally-administered near-complete (\u226590%) stabilizer of Transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of adults with ATTR-CM to reduce cardiovascular death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. The FDA approval is based on positive results seen in the ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study, where Attruby significantly reduced death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization, and improved quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to be part of the celebration for the FDA approval of Attruby. The need for more treatment options for patients living with ATTR-CM is crucial to achieving the goal of better outcomes and improved quality of life. Access to this new therapy means more hope and more opportunity to improve the lives of patients with amyloidosis,\u201d said Muriel Finkel, President of Amyloidosis Support Groups, a non-profit organization dedicated to the support of amyloidosis patients and caregivers.<\/p>\n<p>Attruby is the first and only approved product with a label specifying near-complete stabilization of TTR. Attruby was designed to mimic a naturally occurring &#8220;rescue mutation\u201d of the TTR gene (T119M) that targets the root cause of ATTR-CM, destabilization of the native TTR tetramer. Through near-complete TTR stabilization, Attruby has been shown to preserve the native function of TTR as a transport protein of thyroxine and vitamin A and to demonstrate benefit on cardiovascular outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>The ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study enrolled 632 participants with symptomatic ATTR-CM, associated with either wild-type or variant TTR. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive Attruby or placebo for 30 months. As published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the trial successfully met its primary endpoint of a 4-component composite endpoint of ACM, CVH, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and 6-minute walk distance with a Win Ratio of 1.8 (p&lt;0.0001). Attruby demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect at 30 months on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and 6-minute walk test. Additionally, the increase in NT-proBNP on treatment was about half that of placebo.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis when left untreated. Having a new first line treatment option which provides excellent TTR stabilization and improves outcomes in this disease gives patients more options,\u201d said Martha Grogan, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic. \u201cEncouraging data suggests Attruby reduces all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization as early as three months after initiation of therapy. With continued advances in therapy, this previously fatal disease is becoming a manageable chronic cardiovascular condition.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio\u00a0offers a patient support services program, ForgingBridges<sup>\u2122<\/sup>, for people in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0prescribed Attruby and their families to receive help accessing this new therapy. ForgingBridges includes insurance resources, financial assistance options and a dedicated support team to assist in the treatment journey.

I\u2019m grateful to each trial participant, their families, and the physicians, scientists and our team at BridgeBio who made this possible,\u201d said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., founder and CEO. \u201cOur journey is not over as we look to pursue approvals globally, next in Europe, Japan, and Brazil, and to continue exploring the full potential of this treatment. I am thrilled to extend our mission of \u2018putting patients first\u2019 with this third FDA approval in less than 10 years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025. BridgeBio has granted exclusive rights to Bayer to commercialize acoramidis for ATTR-CM in Europe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Management Remarks on Attruby<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio will share management remarks on key aspects of the Attruby label and important access programs on Friday, November 22, 2024 at 8:00 pm ET.

The majority of these adverse reactions were mild and resolved without drug discontinuation. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were similar between patients treated with Attruby versus placebo (9.3% and 8.5%, respectively).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory Tests<\/strong><br \/>\nMean increase in serum creatinine of 0.2 and 0.0 mg\/dL and a mean decrease in eGFR of 8.2 and 0.7 mL\/min\/1.73 m<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0was observed in the adults with ATTR-CM treated with Attruby versus placebo, respectively, at Day 28 and then stabilized. These changes were reversible after treatment discontinuation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use in Specific Populations<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Pregnancy &amp; Lactation:\u00a0<\/strong>There are no data on the use of Attruby in pregnant women. Animal data have not shown developmental risk associated with the use of Attruby in pregnancy.
