BridgeBio will also receive royalties in a tiered structure beginning in the low-thirties percent on sales of acoramidis in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Acoramidis is an investigational, next-generation, orally-administered, highly potent small molecule stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR). The US FDA has accepted BridgeBio\u2019s NDA for acoramidis for the treatment of ATTR-CM with a PDUFA action date of November 29, 2024; additionally, the EMA has accepted the MAA for acoramidis with potential EU approval in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to have found a like-minded partner in Bayer that shares our belief in the potential of acoramidis to ameliorate the lives of ATTR-CM patients. We have a responsibility to the ATTR-CM community to make acoramidis available to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible, and we believe that Bayer is the right collaborator for us in this mission,\u201d said Ananth Sridhar, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, BridgeBio Cardiorenal. \u201cThis partnership leverages Bayer\u2019s established European cardiovascular infrastructure and enables us, via substantial cost savings, to focus our resources on our wholly-owned geographies for acoramidis, including preparing for the US launch.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In July 2023, BridgeBio\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/news\/bridgebio-announces-consistently-positive-results-from-phase-3-attribute-cm-study-of-acoramidis-for-patients-with-transthyretin-amyloid-cardiomyopathy-attr-cm\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong>announced<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0positive results from ATTRibute-CM, reporting a highly statistically significant result, demonstrated by a Win Ratio of 1.8 (p&lt;0.0001) on the primary endpoint (a hierarchical analysis prioritizing in order: all-cause mortality, then frequency of cardiovascular hospitalization, then change from baseline in N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, then change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance). Acoramidis was well-tolerated, with no safety signals of potential clinical concern identified. BridgeBio has also presented analyses from ATTRibute-CM at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2023 and at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2023. In February 2024, BridgeBio shared positive results of a single-arm Phase 3 study of acoramidis in Japanese patients with ATTR-CM, including no mortality reported in the trial at 30 months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBayer has a clear vision to transform cardiovascular care for patients and acoramidis complements our portfolio in specialty cardiology,\u201d said Juergen Eckhardt, M.D., Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer\u2019s Pharmaceuticals Division and Head of Business Development, Licensing &amp; Open Innovation. \u201cAs a leading player in the field of cardiovascular diseases, we will work to make this new treatment available to patients as soon as possible, after a positive decision by the European authorities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
