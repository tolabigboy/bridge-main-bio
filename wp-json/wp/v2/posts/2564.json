Infigratinib is an investigational, orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/\">BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO)<\/a> affiliate company <a href=\"https:\/\/qedtx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">QED Therapeutics, Inc.<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The investigator-initiated Phase 0\/2 trial is designed to confirm drug effects within days of exposure, and only to continue dosing when the drug is active in a patient\u2019s own tumor. The primary objective of the Phase 0 arm is to assess how effectively infigratinib can cross the blood-brain barrier \u2013 the most significant obstacle to developing new, effective therapies for aggressive brain tumors like glioblastoma. Patients with successful tumor penetration will receive infigratinib long-term in a Phase 2 expansion arm of the trial. The primary endpoint of the expansion phase is progression-free survival rate at six months. The study will also measure how well infigratinib is impacting its molecular target in each patient\u2019s tumor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) genetic alterations have been shown to spur growth in malignant tumors. Five to seven percent of glioblastoma patients\u2019 tumors are driven by FGFR signaling. During the trial screening process, the patient\u2019s tumor tissue from prior surgery will be tested for the FGFR-TACC3 fusion gene or mutations in FGFR1 and FGFR3 genes. Patients with tumors that have these fusions or mutations are eligible for this study.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cIn the preclinical studies, our pharmacokinetics program at the Ivy Brain Tumor Center tested seven FGFR inhibitors for their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Infigratinib was one of the most promising agents,\u201d said Shwetal Mehta, Ph.D., deputy director of the Ivy Brain Tumor Center.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cInfigratinib was previously tested in an uncontrolled Phase 2 study for recurrent high-grade gliomas,\u201d said Nader Sanai, M.D., director of the Ivy Brain Tumor Center. \u201cThe results were intriguing, but inconclusive. This Ivy Phase 0\/2 trial seeks to provide direct biological evidence of drug effects in individual patients, allowing us to understand which glioblastoma patients may benefit from infigratinib.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe launch of this investigator-initiated trial is an exciting step in the study of infigratinib for patients with recurrent, high-grade glioma,\u201d said Susan Moran, M.D., M.S.C.E., chief medical officer of QED Therapeutics. \u201cWe anticipate this study being conducted by the Ivy Center will generate valuable information on the ability of infigratinib to reach brain tumors, which is a critical first step in evaluating whether infigratinib, alone or in combination, could potentially provide a therapeutic option for patients with this dire disease.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For additional information on this Phase 0\/2 trial in recurrent high-grade glioma, including eligibility criteria, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04424966\">www.clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04424966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NCT04424966<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Ivy Brain Tumor Center<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ivybraintumorcenter.org\">Ivy Brain Tumor Center<\/a> at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ is a non-profit translational research program that employs a bold, early-phase clinical trials strategy to identify new treatments for aggressive brain tumors, including glioblastoma.

Our lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown activity that we believe to be meaningful in clinical measures, such as overall response rate, in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED intends to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration for second and later-line cholangiocarcinoma in 2020. QED Therapeutics is also evaluating infigratinib in clinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia. We plan to conduct further clinical trials to evaluate the potential for infigratinib to treat patients with other FGFR-driven tumor types and rare disorders.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on QED Therapeutics, please visit the Company&#8217;s website at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qedtx.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.qedtx.com<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/\">BridgeBio<\/a> is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
