The $127.2 million net increase in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term restricted cash was primarily attributable to net proceeds received from the term loan under the credit facility with Blue Owl of $437.7 million, net proceeds received of $315.3 million from various equity financings, proceeds from the sale of investments in equity securities of $63.2 million, and special cash dividends received from investments in equity securities of $25.7 million. These were primarily offset by refinancing of the Company\u2019s previous senior secured credit and inclusive of prepayment fees and exit-related costs in aggregate of $473.4 million, net cash used in operating activities of $219.5 million and purchases of equity securities of $20.3 million during the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenue for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024, were $211.1 million, as compared to $1.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The $209.3 million net increase for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the recognition of non-refundable upfront payments under the Bayer and the Kyowa Kirin exclusive license agreements. The remaining license and services revenue was recognized in connection with the Navire-BMS License Agreement, which was entered into in May 2022 and for which BMS provided notice of termination in March 2024 with a termination effective in June 2024.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024 were $210.8 million compared to $128.0 million for the same period in the prior year.<\/p>\n<p>The overall increase of $82.8 million in operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to an increase of $48.1 million in research and development and other expenses (R&amp;D) to advance the Company\u2019s pipeline of development programs, and an increase of $34.7 million in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses mainly to support commercialization readiness efforts. Operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024, include $22.5 million of nonrecurring deal-related costs for transactions that were closed during the period.<\/p>\n<p>Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024 amounted to $3.4 million. These charges primarily consisted of impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, severance and employee-related costs, and exit and other related costs. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the same period in the prior year was $3.4 million. These charges primarily consisted of winding down, exit costs, and severance and employee-related costs.<\/p>\n<p>Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024 were $28.9 million, of which $12.8 million is included in R&amp;D expenses, and $16.1 million is included in SG&amp;A expenses.
