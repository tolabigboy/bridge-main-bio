(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio),\u202fa commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, announced today an exclusive license with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop and commercialize BBP-398, a potentially best-in-class SHP2 inhibitor, in oncology.<\/p>\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, BridgeBio will receive an upfront payment of $90 million, up to $815 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments, and tiered royalties in the low- to mid-teens. BridgeBio will retain the option to acquire higher royalties in the United States in connection with funding a portion of development costs upon the initiation of registrational studies.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the terms of the agreement, BridgeBio will continue to lead its ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy and combination therapy trials. Bristol Myers Squibb will lead and fund all other development and commercial activities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are grateful to be expanding our collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, a leader in oncology, and we believe this agreement will allow us to reach even more patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. We believe our SHP2 inhibitor has the potential to be a best-in-class agent given the data we have seen, and we are eager to see our monotherapy and combination trials progress in collaboration with our partners at Bristol Myers Squibb,\u201d said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., founder and CEO of BridgeBio.<\/p>\n<p>SHP2 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that links growth factor, cytokine and integrin signaling with the downstream RAS\/MAPK pathway to regulate cellular proliferation and survival. Overactivity of SHP2 is a critical contributor to many forms of cancer, is a mechanism of resistance to several targeted therapies, and can suppress antitumor immunity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have seen the potential role SHP2 inhibition could play in unlocking possible combination therapies to treat patients suffering from a range of cancers. We are hopeful this collaboration with BridgeBio will help us maximize the possibilities SHP2 inhibition with BBP-398 will hold for patients,\u201d said Rupert Vessey, M.A., B.M., B.Ch., FRCP, D.Phil., Executive Vice President, Research &amp; Early Development, Bristol Myers Squibb.<\/p>\n<p>In July 2021, BridgeBio initially announced a non-exclusive, co-funded clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of BBP-398 with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS mutations. BridgeBio is currently advancing its Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors driven by mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including RAS and receptor tyrosine kinase genes.<\/p>\n<p>OPDIVO\u00ae is a trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BBP-398<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BBP-398 is a SHP2 inhibitor that is being developed for difficult-to-treat cancers and was founded through a collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\u2019s Therapeutics Discovery division. BridgeBio has a strategic collaboration with LianBio for clinical development and commercialization of BBP-398 in combination with various agents in solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, in mainland China and other major Asian markets and clinical collaborations; with Bristol Myers Squibb for combination with OPDIVO\u00ae (nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS mutations; and with Amgen for combination with LUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib), Amgen\u2019s KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> mutations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
