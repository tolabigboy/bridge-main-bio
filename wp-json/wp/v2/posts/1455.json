(Nasdaq: BBIO) subsidiary Origin Biosciences announced today the presentation of a study on the natural history of patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) and isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD). The study was presented at the 2019 SSIEM Annual Symposium held in Rotterdam, Netherlands.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this comprehensive natural history study, 65 patients with MoCD and ISOD were enrolled from 27 participating centers across 14 countries. The majority of patients had MoCD Type A (n=37), followed by MoCD Type B (n=16) and Other (n=12). Data were collected retrospectively for all patients and prospectively for patients in the living cohort for up to one year. The primary endpoint was survival at 1 year of age.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For MoCD Type A patients, the probability of survival at 1 year of age was 0.72 (0.535-0.845) and median survival was 3.98 years. Nearly all patients (n=57) had first presenting symptoms by Day 28 with median onset for MoCD Type A patients at 2\u00a0days. The most common initial symptoms were seizures and feeding difficulties. Other subsequent symptoms included developmental delay, truncal hypotonia with limb hypertonia, and cortical blindness. Median urinary S-sulfocysteine and xanthine concentrations were extremely high, and uric acid levels were drastically low in the first few days of life. Additional biochemical and neuroimaging data were collected. These data were presented during the Disorders of vitamins, cofactors and trace elements poster session at SSIEM. See below for a detailed summary of the data.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Our findings confirm that the vast majority of MoCD and ISOD cases are severe, rapidly progressive, and neurodegenerative, resulting in significant disability and early lethality in almost all cases from the neonatal age,&#8221; said Ronen Spiegel, MD, Clinical Associate Professor, Director of Pediatric B Department, and Head of Metabolic Service, Emek Medical Center, principal investigator and lead author of the study.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Currently there are no approved therapies that alter the course of MoCD or ISOD. BridgeBio Pharma, through its subsidiary Origin Biosciences, is developing BBP-870 (ORGN001), a cPMP substrate replacement therapy that targets MoCD Type A directly at its source. By restoring the natural molybdenum cofactor synthetic pathway, the compound aims to reduce buildup of toxic sulfites and alleviate symptoms in infants and children with MoCD Type A. BBP-870 (ORGN001) has received Orphan Drug Designation in the US and Europe, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, and is currently being evaluated in a global Phase 2 clinical trial and a global Phase 2\/3 clinical trial (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=nbjmVYO0zpoLlSxLhYX1SD95lammIu6d_VN2q1AQYV_9vW1_3Jp4QVmmKW_FBEgyV1xeLlq5u0c2Nmj0RkxXPzAT7zxE-17uBztuG9LvCQc=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NCT02629393<\/a>;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=POj2R0hFb_rgumhY-znUH9T6wakoTcO6PNfg4QzUecuDPjALpa56qtef03QTPjrqq8JFGHKEZ6LFVqsqCivRaUPLzOhADAsZ6QJhfcTuTAE=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NCT02047461<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Key data from the natural history study:<\/strong><br \/><\/u>A photo accompanying this announcement is available at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=x5UIXgP3IFkR05DsAmpCEA-xccA-FAfSvECSUh2-dkSVhx8PSiW-xeXjoa3L_KfBgU3oO_r9qaeGw-t_p2JLLyO4JufCFG2WF1SFTWDBQ3yc0P5H95QzqBwZZMFO6v5nNIKLFKQJ-PLdWdpfS0Wks1MJmmxeYjAdWtjXN393HeuUhYPldBC5aTT4u7XBC5YfgM1QtvrHF1VKq8hXwhANN_aLrTZRdgREz84YtItQwPxuxZPD2ADjj8vVIb260q6TYzE7i63iOvVELq0Uax7NLg==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/NewsRoom\/AttachmentNg\/e270f0a3-80ee-4d0d-9e93-f0a7664270c4<\/a><br \/><br \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"537\" height=\"434\" class=\"wp-image-1456\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image.png 537w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/image-300x242.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>MoCD is a rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism caused by disruption in molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis that is vital for sulfite oxidase (SOX) activity. Patients are often infants with severe encephalopathy and intractable seizures. Disease progression is rapid with a high infant mortality rate.<sup>1,2\u00a0<\/sup>Those who survive beyond the first few months experience profuse developmental delays and suffer the effects of irreversible neurological damage, including brain atrophy with white matter necrosis, dysmorphic facial features, and spastic paraplegia.<sup>1,4<\/sup>\u00a0Clinical presentation that can be similar to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or other neonatal seizure disorders may lead to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.<sup>2,3<\/sup>\u00a0Immediate testing for elevated sulfite levels and S-sulfocysteine in the urine and very low serum uric acid may help with suspicion of MoCD.<sup>2,4<\/sup><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Origin Biosciences<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Origin Biosciences, a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing a treatment for Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Type A.
