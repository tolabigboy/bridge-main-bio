(NASDAQ: BBIO) today announced it has appointed Jennifer Cook to its Board of Directors and will leverage her considerable expertise as a special advisor to the senior management team. Her counsel will help BridgeBio expand its capacity to develop treatments for genetic diseases as quickly and safely as possible.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cJennifer is a seasoned leader in the biotech and pharmaceutical spaces, with decades of experience taking drugs from research to commercialization,\u201d said Richard Scheller, Ph.D., chairman of research and development at BridgeBio. \u201cDuring our time at Roche and Genentech, I saw her launch new medicines and drive growth\u00a0for both companies. I am confident that her appointment to the board will strengthen BridgeBio\u2019s experience\u00a0and capabilities\u00a0in drug commercialization.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cook brings more than 30 years of experience in the global biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Her work includes serving as Chief Executive Officer of GRAIL, Inc., leading Roche Pharma\u2019s European commercial business, heading global clinical operations for Roche product development, and overseeing Genentech\u2019s U.S. Immunology and Ophthalmology Business Unit. Cook was honored as the Woman of the Year by the Healthcare Businesswomen&#8217;s Association in 2016 and was named one of the Most Influential Women in Business by <em>The San Francisco Business Times<\/em> in 2012. Cook joins current board members Neil Kumar, Charles Homcy, Richard Scheller, Eric Aguiar, James Momtazee, and Ali Satvat. She will also serve as a special advisor to Kumar, Ph.D., the founder and CEO of BridgeBio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cAs BridgeBio evolves into a commercial company that serves patients with genetic diseases and supports the physicians who care for them, we require more expertise and guidance as it relates to commercial activity,\u201d said Dr. Kumar. \u201cJennifer brings that expertise and more, having run a massive commercial organization in Europe. She also offers strategic perspectives on how to manage commercial infrastructure in a company like ours, which has a strong central team supporting a growing network of affiliate companies. Jennifer is a leader I admire and I look forward to partnering with and learning from her.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWhat interests me most about BridgeBio is its remarkable people and their focus on turning early-stage innovation in academic laboratories and leading medical institutions into drug discovery programs as quickly and efficiently as possible,\u201d said Cook. \u201cI look forward to applying my experience in biotech product development and commercialization to the important therapeutic areas BridgeBio is currently working on to help the team bring these treatments to patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
