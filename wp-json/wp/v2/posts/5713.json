Based on the terms of the agreement, BridgeBio continues to lead its ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy and combination therapy trials. Bristol Myers Squibb will lead and fund all other development and commercial activities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sale of PRV for $110 million: <\/strong>Entered into a definitive agreement with an undisclosed purchaser to sell its PRV for $110 million. The Company received the voucher in February 2021 through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of NULIBRY (fosdenopterin) for injection as the first therapy to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MoCD Type A.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Two-year extension for principal payment on senior debt: <\/strong>Executed an amendment to the Company\u2019s existing senior secured credit facility. Amendment extended the interest-only period by two years and principal repayment to November 17, 2026.

The amendment was approved unanimously by existing lenders in the syndicate without adjusting pricing and without imposing financial covenants.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Positive Phase 1 data and Phase 2\/3 trial design for GO inhibitor for patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and recurrent kidney stone formers: <\/strong>Positive data in a <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/e84c3b55-d92b-4d88-b2d1-eb4666e513e6\">feature oral presentation<\/a> at the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN 2022) showed that BBP-711 led to near complete inhibition of glycolate oxidase throughout the dosing period and greater than 10-fold increases in plasma glycolate, suggesting it has the potential to be both a best-in-class therapy and the first oral therapy for PH1 and recurrent kidney stone formations. Overproduction of oxalate in hyperoxaluria, including PH1 and recurrent kidney stone formation with elevated oxalate, can lead to kidney stone formation, nephrocalcinosis and renal impairment. PH1 affects an estimated 5,000 patients in the US and EU, while recurrent stone formers are much more common, affecting an estimated 1.5 million individuals in the US and EU. Based on the tolerability and potency of the oral therapy, BridgeBio has met with regulators and intends to initiate a Phase 2\/3 pivotal study by the end of 2022. At the end of 2022, BridgeBio also intends to launch a Phase 2 study of BBP-711 in adult recurrent kidney stone formers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Positive early data for investigational AAV9 gene therapy in Canavan disease: <\/strong>Promising pharmacodynamic data from the first two participants dosed in the Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of BBP-812 for the treatment of Canavan disease. Results showed unprecedented decreases in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain and urine, suggesting the therapy is producing functional ASPA enzyme. Affecting approximately 1,000 children in the US and EU, Canavan disease is an ultra-rare, disabling and fatal disease with no approved therapy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Positive data in healthy volunteers to support BBP-671 for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) and organic acidemias:<\/strong> Positive interim Phase 1 data from healthy volunteers was shared in a <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/d818ce7d-b47c-46a7-8bcc-e291b46608e7\">scientific poster session<\/a> in support of the development of BBP-671 for PKAN and organic acidemias at the Pan American Parkinson and Movement Disorders (PAS) Congress. Results showed that BBP-671 was detected in healthy volunteer plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that BBP-671 is entering the brain, a location critical to target neurological complications of PKAN and organic acidemias at their source. BBP-671 also increased whole blood acetyl-coenzyme-A (CoA) levels in healthy volunteers, a signal supporting proof of mechanism of the therapy. These data represent, to the best of the Company\u2019s knowledge, the first time acetyl-CoA has been directly increased by a pharmacological intervention in humans. Based on these data, BridgeBio intends to move forward with the second part of the Phase 1 clinical study in patients with propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia in the second half of 2022 and plans to initiate a pivotal Phase 2\/3 study in PKAN in 2023.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Positive data from PTR-01 in patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB): <\/strong>Shared updates on positive Phase 2 data in a <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/56f5b14a-ff20-4141-a255-21199abb3bb1\">poster<\/a> at the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) Annual Meeting 2022. Treatment with PTR-01 led to rapid, consistent, and durable wound healing as observed in reduction of wound surface area and clinician-reported assessments. All patients that completed the study reported a decrease in pain over the course of treatment with PTR-01.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Positive preliminary data in patients with venous, lymphatic and mixed venolymphatic malformations (VM, LM and VLM):<\/strong> Positive Phase 1b data for VM, LM and VLM was shared in a <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/dc3dbbd2-b3a8-4122-ad1d-3c63c185e717\">virtual presentation<\/a> at the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA). Data showed that the investigational drug was well-tolerated and showed a reduction of pS6 in lesions from baseline to day 28.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Positive opinion from CHMP for NULIBRY (fosdenopterin):<\/strong> The CHMP of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending approval of NULIBRY in the EU for the treatment of patients with MoCD Type A. Opinion is based on the efficacy and safety data collected to date compared to data from a natural history study. Under an accelerated assessment pathway, a decision by the European Commission (EC), which authorizes marketing approval in the EU, is expected later this year. If approved by the EC, NULIBRY would be the first and only approved therapy in the EU to treat patients with MoCD type A, an ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorder that often progresses rapidly in infants with a median overall survival age of about four years. NULIBRY was BridgeBio\u2019s first FDA-approved therapeutic. Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. acquired global rights to NULIBRY in March 2022.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Academic research collaborations:<\/strong> Initiated an academic partnership with Baylor School of Medicine, and a founding affiliation with Bakar Labs, the incubator at UC Berkeley\u2019s Bakar BioEnginuity Hub.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $688.6 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to $787.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The net decrease of $98.9 million is primarily attributable to net cash used in operating activities of $191.1 million. The net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by a $90.0 million in upfront payment received under the License, Development and Commercialization Agreement between the Company, its affiliate, Navire Pharma, Inc., and Bristol Myers Squibb (the \u201cNavire-BMS License Agreement\u201d). During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company also received upfront payments of $110.0 million from the sale of its priority review voucher and $10.0 million upon closing of an asset purchase agreement between its affiliate, Origin Biosciences, Inc., and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. The Company also made a $20.5 million mandatory prepayment of a portion of its term loan obligations under its Amended Loan and Security Agreement in connection with the upfront payment received from BMS.<\/p>\n<p>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, increased by $55.1 million when compared to the balance as of March 31, 2022 of $633.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities, which was partially offset by a $90.0 million in upfront payment received from BMS, was $30.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities was $160.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Operating costs and expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were $153.9 million and $329.3 million, respectively, as compared to $148.0 million and $316.0 million for the same periods in the prior year. The overall increase in operating costs and expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the comparative periods was due mainly to costs incurred related to the restructuring initiative that was started in the first quarter of 2022. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 of $8.4 million and $31.1 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, severance and employee-related expenses, and exit costs. The Company continues to evaluate restructuring alternatives to drive operational changes in business processes, efficiencies, and cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe expect that operating expenses and cash burn will continue to decline meaningfully in the third and fourth quarters as restructuring charges decline and anticipated additional business development activity allows us to further decrease from this baseline. Cash on hand provides us with runway into 2024,\u201d said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA, BridgeBio\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.<\/p>\n<p>The Company\u2019s research and development and other expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented. While BridgeBio experienced some delays in certain of its clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, it continues to adapt with alternative site, telehealth and home visits, and at-home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with its contract manufacturing organizations. The longer-term impact, if any, of COVID-19 on BridgeBio\u2019s operating costs and expenses is currently unknown.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5737 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_1.png 785w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_1-300x298.png 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_1-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_1-768x763.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5738 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_2.png 759w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_2-300x253.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5739 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_3-e1659614511302.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"786\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_3-e1659614511302.png 786w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_3-e1659614511302-253x300.png 253w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BBIO_Q2_3-e1659614511302-768x912.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" \/><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5742\" src=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/earningspr-300x101.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/earningspr-300x101.png 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/earningspr-768x259.png 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/earningspr.png 897w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
