(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, presented a post-hoc analysis evaluating the effect of acoramidis on the composite endpoint of ACM and recurrent CVH events in its Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study in ATTR-CM at the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Annual Scientific Meeting 2024. ATTRibute-CM was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acoramidis, an investigational, near-complete, orally-administered, small molecule stabilizer of TTR.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are proud to share the results of this post-hoc analysis demonstrating a highly significant reduction in all-cause mortality and the sum of recurrent CV-related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR-CM at 30 Months in the ATTRibute-CM trial,\u201d said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of BridgeBio Cardiorenal. \u201cAt BridgeBio, we believe in the importance of both data transparency and continued communication of additional details of this landmark trial, especially to assist physicians choosing ATTR-CM therapies for their patients who rely on their healthcare provider\u2019s recommendations. By conducting and presenting multiple analyses, we hope to both advance the clinical science around ATTR-CM trials and highlight the potential for acoramidis to be a meaningful treatment option for patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The analysis, shared by Daniel Judge, M.D., professor of medicine and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina in an oral presentation, included:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>A 42% reduction in composite ACM and recurrent CVH events at 30 months observed with acoramidis treatment compared to placebo by applying a negative binomial regression model (post-hoc) (p=0.0005)<\/li>\n<li>A 42% reduction in the total number of ACM and recurrent CVH events per patient observed over 30 months with acoramidis treatment compared to placebo<\/li>\n<li>A 30.5% hazard reduction in ACM and recurrent CVH events at 30 months observed with acoramidis treatment compared to placebo by applying the Andersen-Gill model (post-hoc) (p=0.0008)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThis post-hoc analysis provides further evidence that near-complete TTR stabilization with acoramidis can improve clinical outcomes for patients with ATTR-CM. The reduction of hospitalizations and all-cause mortality seen in ATTRibute-CM heightens the case for acoramidis as a first-line therapy given its potential to improve the overall quality of life for patients,\u201d said Dr. Judge.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, during the Annual Scientific Session of the Japanese College of Cardiology (JCC), Jin Endo, M.D., Ph.D., Keio University School of Medicine of Tokyo, Japan presented positive results from the Phase 3 trial of acoramidis in adults with ATTR-CM conducted by Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease in Japan, which has exclusive rights to commercialize acoramidis in Japan. No mortality was reported over the treatment period of 30 months. Results showed consistency with the ATTRibute-CM results, including survival, CVH and other measures of physical function (measured by six-minute walk test) and quality of life (measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score) at 30 months.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the positive results from ATTRibute-CM, BridgeBio submitted a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has been accepted with a PDUFA action date of November 29, 2024, and a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma Inc.
