(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced that preclinical data for its two lead RAS programs \u2013 a next-generation KRAS G12C dual inhibitor program and a PI3K\u03b1:RAS breaker program \u2013 will be featured in an oral presentation on Monday, October 17<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0at the Fourth RAS Initiative Symposium. The Symposium will take place in Frederick, MD on October 17-19, 2022. Details about the oral presentation and the investor call and webcast are listed below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>KRAS G12C dual inhibitor:<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio has selected a next-generation KRAS G12C dual inhibitor development candidate and plans to enter the clinic in 2023. The Company\u2019s development candidate is the first-known small molecule that directly binds and inhibits KRAS G12C in both its active (GTP bound) and inactive (GDP bound) conformations. BridgeBio believes this could lead to differentiated activity in cancer patients with KRAS G12C driven disease, as all other known clinical stage direct KRAS G12C inhibitors do not inhibit the active oncogenic form of the protein (GTP-bound KRAS G12C).<\/p>\n<p><strong>PI3K\u03b1:RAS<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>breaker<\/strong><strong><u>:<\/u><\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio is also pursuing PI3K\u03b1:RAS breakers, small molecules that block RAS driven PI3K\u03b1 activation. Inhibiting PI3K\u03b1 activity by preventing its interaction with RAS can provide a \u201ctumor selective\u201d mechanism that spares glucose metabolism. This novel approach could, if successful, potentially have broad utility against oncogene-driven tumors as both a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Oral presentation details:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Title:\u00a0<\/strong>Novel Approaches to Target RAS Driven Cancers<br \/>\n<strong>Presenter:<\/strong>\u00a0Eli Wallace, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Oncology at BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<br \/>\n<strong>Oral session date &amp; time:\u00a0<\/strong>Monday, October 17<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0at 9:50 am \u2013 12:30 pm ET<\/p>\n<p><strong>Webcast Information<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to discuss preclinical data from both lead RAS programs and the selection of the KRAS G12C dual inhibitor development candidate on October 17, 2022\u00a0at\u00a01:30 pm ET.
