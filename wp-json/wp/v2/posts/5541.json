(Nasdaq: BBIO), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced promising pharmacodynamic data from the first two participants dosed in CAN<em>aspire<\/em>, its Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of BBP-812, an investigational intravenous (IV) adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease. Canavan disease is an ultra-rare and fatal disease with no approved therapies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTaken together, these robust decreases in urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain N-acetylaspartate (NAA), along with MRI signs of new myelination reported by the principal investigator are exciting and suggest we are on the right track when it comes to potentially making a difference for patients with this disease, and we look forward to gathering more data as the trial progresses,\u201d said Genevieve Laforet, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of clinical development at Aspa Therapeutics, the BridgeBio Gene Therapy affiliate company developing the gene therapy for Canavan disease. \u201cWe are continuing to recruit and dose new participants for CAN<em>aspire <\/em>and we are grateful to be able to collaborate with the advocacy organizations in the Canavan community in the pursuit of potential meaningful therapeutic advances for children with this cruel and fatal\u00a0disorder.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Data from the first two CAN<em>aspire<\/em> participants show rapid and robust post-treatment decreases in NAA in urine, and importantly, in CSF and brain tissue as shown by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), to a degree not seen in available natural history data. Reduction in brain NAA is an early signal suggesting that BBP-812 administered IV has reached its intended target behind the blood-brain-barrier and is expressing functional aspartoacylase (ASPA) enzyme. There is evidence in the scientific literature that lower NAA levels are associated with milder disease. More time will be needed to see how these reductions in NAA translate to clinical outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>From a safety standpoint, IV infusions of BBP-812 have been well-tolerated, and to date, no participants have experienced a treatment-related serious adverse event. BridgeBio reported:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At Month 6 post-treatment, Participant 1 showed:\n<ul>\n<li>77% lowering of NAA in the CSF<\/li>\n<li>15% reduction in NAA in brain white matter by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) imaging<\/li>\n<li>~50% decrease in urine NAA<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>At Month 3 post-treatment, Participant 2 showed:\n<ul>\n<li>89% reduction of NAA in CSF<\/li>\n<li>&gt;50% decrease in NAA in brain white matter by MRS imaging<\/li>\n<li>81% drop in urine NAA<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cTo see this biochemical change suggests that we are reaching cells critical to the disease process, a milestone in this disease. The ongoing myelination seen on MRI and the new interactions witnessed between children and their parents are both encouraging,&#8221; said Florian Eichler, M.D., director of the Leukodystrophy Service and principal investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead investigator of the CAN<em>aspire <\/em>trial.<\/p>\n<p>While the data reported here are still early and the final safety and efficacy profile of the investigational gene therapy remains to be fully established, BridgeBio believes these data show the potential of BBP-812.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBridgeBio\u2019s early trial results are deeply encouraging for the Canavan community,\u201d said Orren Alperstein, president of the Canavan Foundation, whose daughter Morgan died in 1997 of Canavan disease. \u201cThese preliminary but unprecedented decreases in brain and urine NAA suggest that meaningful progress is underway for patients and their families. The thoughtful and careful approach BridgeBio is taking in this trial continues to impress me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Data on the first two CAN<em>aspire<\/em> participants will be presented on Friday, July 8, 2022, during Research Day at the National Tay Sachs &amp; Allied Diseases Association Annual Family Conference in Denver, Colorado. A broader Phase 1\/2 data readout, including safety and efficacy data and updates on the pharmacodynamic data, for Canavan disease is expected later in 2022.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About CAN<em>aspire\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CAN<em>aspire <\/em>is a Phase 1\/2 open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic activity of BridgeBio\u2019s AAV9 gene therapy candidate, BBP-812, in pediatric patients with Canavan disease. Each eligible patient will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of BBP-812. The primary outcomes of the study are safety, as well as change from baseline of urine and central nervous system N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels. Motor function and development will also be assessed.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u202ftrial, visit\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/treatcanavan.com\/\"><strong>TreatCanavan.com<\/strong><\/a>\u202for ClinicalTrials.gov (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04998396\">NCT04998396<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BBP-812<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BBP-812 is an investigational AAV9 gene therapy for Canavan disease. Using AAV gene therapy, BridgeBio seeks to deliver functional copies of the\u202f<em>ASPA\u202f<\/em>gene throughout the body and into the brain, potentially correcting the disease at its source. Preclinical proof-of-concept results have shown the approach restores survival and normal motor function in Canavan disease models. BBP-812 was granted Fast Track Designation, Rare Pediatric Drug Designation, and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. BBP-812 was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Canavan Disease<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Affecting approximately 1,000 children in the United States and European Union, Canavan disease is an ultra-rare, disabling and fatal disease with no approved therapy. Most children are not able to meet developmental milestones, are unable to crawl, walk, sit or talk, and die at a young age. The disease is caused by an inherited mutation of the\u202f<em>ASPA<\/em>\u202fgene that codes for aspartoacylase, a protein that breaks down a compound called N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Deficiency of aspartoacylase activity results in accumulation of NAA, and ultimately results in toxicity to myelin in ways that are not currently well understood. Myelin insulates neuronal axons, and without it, neurons are unable to send and receive messages as they should. The current standard of care for Canavan disease is limited to supportive therapy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
