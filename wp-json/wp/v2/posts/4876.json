(Nasdaq: BBIO) today announced the first patient has been treated in a Phase 2a clinical trial of infigratinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) gene amplification and other advanced solid tumors with FGFR genomic alterations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cInfigratinib is a potent and selective FGFR inhibitor that has demonstrated compelling clinical activity across multiple tumor types with FGFR alterations,\u201d said Yizhe Wang, Ph.D., chief executive officer of LianBio. \u201cGiven the disproportionately high prevalence rate of gastric cancer in China, LianBio is pursuing a region-specific development strategy focused on this area of great unmet need. This study marks LianBio\u2019s first trial initiation and demonstrates our continued progress in delivering potentially transformational medicines to patients in Asia.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>TRUSELTIQ\u2122 (infigratinib) is an oral selective inhibitor of FGFR1-3 that is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. It is also being further evaluated in clinical trials based on demonstration of clinical activity in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. LianBio in-licensed rights from BridgeBio for infigratinib for development and commercialization in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 2a trial is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in China designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of infigratinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with FGFR2 gene amplification and other advanced solid tumors with FGFR alterations. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints include duration of response, safety, disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Preclinical data have demonstrated the potential infigratinib may have for patients with gastric cancer. These results, published in <em>Cancer Discovery<\/em>, demonstrated tumor regression in multiple <em>in vivo<\/em> FGFR2 amplified gastric models.<sup>1\u00a0<\/sup><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe believe that infigratinib could have a meaningful impact for people living with gastric cancer as well as many other cancers with FGFR alterations, and are pleased LianBio is initiating this clinical trial in China where more therapeutic options are needed to match the growing diagnosis rate,\u201d said BridgeBio founder and chief executive officer Neil Kumar, Ph.D. \u201cOn the heels of TRUSELTIQ recently obtaining accelerated approval in the United States, we are hopeful that this trial will yield pivotal results in another subset of cancer patients as we continue to build our portfolio of oncology indications with the aim of reaching as many people in need as possible.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About <\/strong><strong>TRUSELTIQ\u2122 (<\/strong><strong>infigratinib)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>TRUSELTIQ (infigratinib) is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, tyrosine kinase inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) that received accelerated approval from the FDA in the United States for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. TRUSELTIQ targets the FGFR protein, blocking downstream activity. In clinical studies, TRUSELTIQ demonstrated a clinically meaningful rate of tumor shrinkage (overall response rate) and duration of response. TRUSELTIQ is not FDA-approved for any other indication in the United States and is not approved for use by any other health authority, including any Chinese or other Asian health authority. It is currently being evaluated in clinical studies for first-line cholangiocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer), locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, and other advanced solid tumors with FGFR genomic alterations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.

Strategic Alliance<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2020, LianBio entered into a strategic alliance with BridgeBio, a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, to develop and commercialize BridgeBio\u2019s programs in China and other major Asian markets. This strategic relationship initially focuses on two of BridgeBio\u2019s targeted oncology drug candidates: FGFR inhibitor infigratinib, for the treatment of FGFR-driven tumors, and SHP2 inhibitor BBP-398, in development for tumors driven by MAPK pathway mutations. The agreement also provides LianBio with preferential future access in China and certain other major Asian markets to more than 20 drug development candidates currently owned or controlled by BridgeBio. This collaboration is designed to advance and accelerate BridgeBio\u2019s programs in China and other major Asian markets, allowing BridgeBio and LianBio to potentially bring innovation to large numbers of patients with high unmet need.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
