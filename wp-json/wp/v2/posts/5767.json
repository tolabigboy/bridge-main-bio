BBO-8520 is the first-known small molecule that directly binds and inhibits\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em><sup><em>G12C<\/em><\/sup>\u00a0in both its active (GTP bound) and inactive (GDP bound) conformations. BridgeBio believes this could lead to differentiated activity in cancer patients with\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em><sup><em>G12C<\/em><\/sup>\u00a0driven disease, as all other known clinical stage direct\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em><sup><em>G12C<\/em><\/sup>\u00a0inhibitors do not inhibit the active oncogenic form of the protein (GTP-bound\u00a0<em>KRAS<\/em><sup><em>G12C<\/em><\/sup>).<\/p>\n<p><u>Presentation highlights:<\/u><br \/>\nThe KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0GTP\/GDP dual inhibitor development candidate<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Using mass spectrometry, BBO-8520 was shown to completely modify both GTP (active) and GDP (inactive) forms of KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup><\/li>\n<li>BBO-8520 shows exceptional potency and selectivity \u2013 significantly greater potency than first-generation KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0GDP-only inhibitors across multiple in vitro and in vivo assays including KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>:RAF1 effector binding<\/li>\n<li>Targeting KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0GTP allows BBO-8520 to overcome growth factor override that is an important source of resistance for 1<sup>st<\/sup>-generation KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0GDP-only inhibitors<\/li>\n<li>BBO-8520 shows strong efficacy in KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0models, including deep regressions in an NSCLC model and differentiated activity vs a first-generation KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0GDP-only inhibitor in a patient-derived xenograft model<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>PI3K\u03b1:RAS breaker:<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio is also pursuing PI3K\u03b1:RAS breakers, small molecules that block RAS driven PI3K\u03b1 activation. Inhibiting PI3K\u03b1 activity by preventing its interaction with RAS can provide a \u201ctumor selective\u201d mechanism that spares glucose metabolism. This novel approach could, if successful, potentially have broad utility against oncogene-driven tumors (including RAS mutant tumors, PI3K\u03b1 mutant tumors, and tumors driven by RTK activation of RAS signaling) as both a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.<\/p>\n<p><u>Presentation highlights:<\/u><br \/>\nPI3K\u03b1:RAS breakers<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Exhibited potent inhibition of AKT activation in KRAS<sup>\u00a0G12<\/sup><sup>X<\/sup>, PIK3CA helical mutation and HER family driven populations<\/li>\n<li>Showed potent efficacy in multiple models without hyperglycemia, a common dose-limiting adverse reaction among PI3K\u03b1 kinase inhibitors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited about our next-generation KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup>\u00a0GTP\/GDP dual inhibitor development candidate and are hopeful that it has the opportunity to deliver improved outcomes for patients given the considerable unmet need remaining in the KRAS-driven cancer space,\u201d said Eli Wallace, Chief Scientific Officer, Oncology at BridgeBio. \u201cWe also think that the progress of our novel PI3K\u03b1:RAS breaker program is very compelling, especially its in vivo demonstration of efficacy without hyperglycemia, which has proven a challenge for standard PI3Ka inhibitor treatments.
