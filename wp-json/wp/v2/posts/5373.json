(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, and its affiliate company ML Bio Solutions, today announced positive data from the Phase 2 study of BBP-418 in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i (LGMD2i). The results are featured in a poster at the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) 2022 Annual Meeting, taking place in Nashville, Tennessee on March 13 \u2013 16, 2022.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio believes these initial results indicate the potential for BBP-418 to increase glycosylation of \u03b1DG and drive functional improvements for patients, as well as reduce CK, a key marker of muscle breakdown. Furthermore, the 90- and 180-day data show improvements on walk tests from baseline, which the Company believes suggests a potential impact on clinical function and on the rate of disease progression.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cTo date, people with LGMD2i have no approved disease-modifying treatment options. Many of these patients see their quality of life deteriorate rapidly and lose their functional independence, including their ability to walk. Our preliminary trial data holds promise for this unmet patient need as our investigational therapy is shown to be generally well-tolerated and to improve several key markers associated with a patient\u2019s decline,\u201d said Douglas Sproule, M.D., M.Sc., chief medical officer of ML Bio Solutions. ML Bio Solutions, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is the affiliate company of BridgeBio that is focused on developing BBP-418 for LGMD2i.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio plans to engage with regulatory health bodies in 2022 to discuss potential paths to approval and intends to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of the year. At MDA 2022, BridgeBio is also presenting Phase 1 trial data of BBP-418 in healthy volunteers to support its LGMD2i program. The Phase 1 study demonstrated broad tolerability across a wide range of dosing, including doses beyond expected therapeutic range. No dose limiting toxicity was observed.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 2 trial enrolled 14 participants, including both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients with LGMD2i. The open-label study is designed to explore the safety and tolerability, feasibility, and usefulness of selected clinical efficacy and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of patients with LGMD2i receiving ascending doses of BBP-418 across three cohorts. Based on the data observed after 90 and 180 days of treatment, BridgeBio observed:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Participants showed an average 0.21 or 43% increase in the ratio of glycosylated \u03b1DG to total \u03b1DG, signifying that the oral therapy has the potential to address both the root cause of LGMD2i and drive functional improvements for patients<\/li>\r\n<li>Participants showed statistically significant declines in all cohorts for CK, of 70% at day 90 for all cohorts and 77% at day 180 for cohorts 1 and 2. 11 of 12 participants received at least 50% reduction in CK with 75% of participants reaching 2x the normal range, suggesting a reduction in muscle breakdown<\/li>\r\n<li>All cohorts demonstrated a 0.08 m\/sec (3%) increase in 10MWT velocity at day 90 and 0.12 m\/sec (4%) increase at day 180 for cohorts 1 and 2. This result is encouraging in correlating the positive biomarker changes to potential clinical outcomes<\/li>\r\n<li>The 10MWTs were measured at six months and compare favorably to natural history data where the same patients demonstrated a decline of 0.12 m\/sec in the 10MWT in the 6-months prior to enrollment in the Phase 2 study<\/li>\r\n<li>BBP-418 was well-tolerated across a wide range of dose levels with no treatment-related serious adverse events, dose limiting toxicities or discontinuations observed<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe positive results from the Phase 2 study exceed expectations and are incredibly exciting as they demonstrate consistent improvements in key markers of muscle function and support further study,\u201d said Amy Harper, M.D., professor in the department of neurology at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and primary investigator of the Phase 2 clinical trial in LGMD2i. \u201cThe close collaboration with BridgeBio and ML Bio Solutions on this trial has provided patient focused data that addresses a serious unmet need in a rare disease.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With approximately 7,000 patients in the U.S. and European Union with potentially treatable mutations, LGMD2i is an inherited autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by the mutation of fukutin-related protein (FKRP), which results in hypoglycosylation of \u03b1DG. BBP-418 is designed to allow the muscle cell to properly glycosylate \u03b1DG, allowing \u03b1DG to function normally and potentially resulting in improved muscle strength and function for patients. If the development program is successful, the Company believes BBP-418 could be the first approved therapy for the treatment of patients with LGMD2i.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Focused execution is BridgeBio\u2019s top priority as it advances its pipeline of high-quality programs to help patients as quickly as possible. The Company remains dedicated to strategically developing and delivering transformative medicines for genetic diseases and cancers with unmet need.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Webcast Information<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to share updates on the Phase 2 data for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i on March 14, 2022\u00a0at\u00a08:00 AM ET.

LGMD2i is a disease that has pediatric symptomatic onset with most individuals developing manifestations of disease between 5 and 18 years of age.\u00a0Clinical manifestations typically present as a skeletal myopathy affecting the lower and then upper limbs, which is commonly later accompanied by respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle involvement.\u00a0Patients who harbor a homozygous genotype typically develop disease manifestations during late childhood with progression to loss of independent ambulation (25%), assisted ventilation (5%), and cardiomyopathy (10%) in adulthood. Cardiomyopathy is progressive, with an annual loss of 0.4% of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients with heterozygous genotypes have an earlier childhood onset with a more severe clinical course, rapid loss of mobility by 20 years of age, more frequent cardiac involvement (25%), and eventual respiratory failure by 30 years of age in nearly all cases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma Inc.
