(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, today announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to oral infigratinib under development for children with achondroplasia.<\/p>\n<p>Breakthrough Therapy Designation is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of drugs in the U.S. that meet stringent criteria. Drugs qualifying for this Designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the first ever for a treatment being developed for children with achondroplasia, marks another important milestone for our skeletal dysplasia program. This recognition by the FDA further confirms the strength of our Phase 2 data, and the substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. We are excited by what this means for the community, and we look forward to working closely with FDA to expedite the development of infigratinib and access for families to an oral option,\u201d said Adora Ndu, Pharm.D., J.D., Chief Regulatory Affairs Officer of BridgeBio.<\/p>\n<p>The Designation was received based on PROPEL 2 data, which showed that in Cohort 5, infigratinib resulted in a statistically significant and sustained increase in AHV, with a mean change from baseline of +2.51cm\/yr at Month 12, and +2.50 cm\/yr at Month 18 (p=0.0015). There was also statistically significant improvement in body proportionality at Month 18 (p-value of 0.001).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the outside perspective, achondroplasia may appear to affect only the height of an individual. The reality is that achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia which could impact aspects of health-related quality of life and functionality. As a parent of a teenager with achondroplasia and an advocate for the community, I am pleased to learn that the FDA has granted infigratinib with its Breakthrough Therapy Designation,\u201d said Munira Shamim, Founder of Growing Stronger, a U.S. advocacy group that supports research and develops resources for the care of individuals with achondroplasia. \u201cThis action represents a significant step towards offering the first oral treatment option more readily for families living with achondroplasia. Having a wider range of therapies empowers families with greater control and choice over their healthcare decisions. We are grateful to the medical, research, and regulatory communities for recognizing and addressing the needs of families with achondroplasia, allowing them to potentially lead lives with increased confidence and improved functionality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>PROPEL 3, the global Phase 3 registrational study of infigratinib in achondroplasia, continues to enroll on schedule, with completion of enrollment anticipated by the end of the year.
