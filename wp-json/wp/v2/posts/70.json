(Eidos) (Nasdaq:EIDX), today announced positive results of its Phase 2 clinical trial studying AG10 in subjects with symptomatic transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). The data were presented in a late-breaking Featured Science oral presentation at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions. AG10 was well tolerated, demonstrated &gt;90% TTR average stabilization at day 28, and increased serum TTR concentrations, a prognostic indicator of survival in ATTR-CM, in a dose-dependent manner. Subject to discussions with regulatory agencies, these data support the advancement of AG10 into Phase 3 pivotal trials planned to be initiated in the first half of 2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThese data demonstrate that AG10 is well tolerated in symptomatic patients with ATTR-CM with clear evidence of drug activity in all actively treated subjects,\u201d said Jonathan Fox, MD, PhD, president and chief medical officer of Eidos. \u201cThe consistently high levels of TTR stabilization, in all actively treated subjects and across the entire dosing interval, were correlated with statistically significant and dose-dependent increases in serum TTR concentrations. We observed normalized serum TTR levels in 100% of patients treated with AG10. We believe these data provide clinical proof-<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>of-concept for AG10 in ATTR-CM patients. As reflected in these data, AG10\u2019s TTR-stabilizing properties continue to hold great promise that it could become a best-in-class treatment for ATTR-CM.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Phase 2 Clinical Trial<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This Phase 2 clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study that enrolled patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM, both wild-type and mutant. Eligible patients had confirmed ATTR-CM and NYHA Class II or III symptoms, and at least one prior heart failure hospitalization or active treatment for chronic heart failure. The 49 enrolled subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to treatment with placebo, 400 mg AG10 twice daily, or 800 mg AG10 twice daily for 28 days. Results from the study showed the following:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The study met its primary objective of establishing that AG10 was well tolerated with no safety signals of potential clinical concern related to the administration of AG10 in symptomatic ATTR-CM patients. One serious adverse event (SAE) of dyspnea deemed unrelated to study drug was observed in one actively-treated subject (3%) and SAEs of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and cellulitis were observed in two placebo-treated subjects (12%). The overall rate of adverse events (AEs) was 69% in subjects administered 800 mg bid AG10, 63% in subjects administered 400 mg bid AG10, and 88% in subjects administered placebo.<\/li>\r\n<li>As compared to placebo, subjects treated with AG10 demonstrated a statistically significant increase in serum TTR concentrations (p&lt;0.0001), a prognostic indicator of survival in ATTR-CM patients, in a dose-dependent manner. Subjects administered 800 mg AG10 twice daily, 400 mg AG10 twice daily, and placebo exhibited mean changes in TTR concentration from baseline of +50%, +36% and -7%, respectively, at day 28.<\/li>\r\n<li>All subjects administered AG10 had serum TTR concentrations within the normal range at day 28, whereas 31% of subjects administered placebo had serum TTR concentrations below the normal range on day 28.<\/li>\r\n<li>AG10 administration resulted in near-complete stabilization of TTR at day 28 (&gt;90%, on average), across the dosing interval in all actively treated subjects as measured by established ex vivo assays.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;We know that stabilizing TTR can lead to clinical benefit in ATTR patients, that treatment with a stabilizer increases TTR levels in ATTR-CM patients, and that higher serum concentrations of TTR are associated with a better prognosis in ATTR-CM,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Judge, M.D., professor in the division of cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. \u201cThese Phase 2 data provide compelling evidence that AG10 stabilizes TTR to a high degree and restores serum TTR levels to normal even in patients carrying destabilizing mutations, suggesting the potential for the molecule to become an effective disease-modifying therapy for ATTR patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investor Conference Call and Webcast Details<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Eidos management will host an investor conference call and webcast on Monday, November 12 at 8am ET to review the Phase 2 data.

AG10 is currently being studied in an open-label extension of a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 was designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a \u201crescue mutation\u201d because it has been shown to prevent ATTR in individuals carrying pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutations in the TTR gene. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in development that has been observed to mimic the \u201csuper-stabilizing\u201d properties of this rescue mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>ATTR represents a significant unmet need of a comparatively large patient population in the context of rare genetic diseases with an inadequate current standard of care. There are three distinct diseases that comprise the ATTR family: wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM), mutant ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRm-CM), and ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN). The worldwide prevalence of each disease is approximately 400,000 patients, 40,000 patients and 10,000 patients, respectively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All three forms of ATTR are progressive and fatal. For patients with ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM, symptoms usually manifest later in life (age 50+), with median survival of three to five years from diagnosis. ATTR-PN either presents in a patient&#8217;s early 30s or later (age 50+), and results in a median life expectancy of five to ten years from diagnosis. Progression of all forms of ATTR causes significant morbidity, impacts productivity and quality of life, and creates a significant economic burden due to the costs associated with progressively greater patient needs for supportive care.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Eidos Therapeutics<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Eidos Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the large and growing unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR).
