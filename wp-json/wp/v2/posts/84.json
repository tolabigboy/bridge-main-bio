(Eidos) (Nasdaq:EIDX) announced the presentation of results from its Phase 1 clinical trial of AG10 during a poster session at the 22nd Annual Scientific Meeting of the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA). The poster, entitled \u201cAG10, A Novel, Potent, and Selective Transthyretin Stabilizer, Is Well-Tolerated at Doses Resulting in Target Therapeutic Blood Levels, and Demonstrates Clinical Proof-of-Concept in Healthy Volunteers,\u201d was presented on Saturday, September 15, and is accessible through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Ohn33FNP2I_fRiJwq1SCO8DM98R4aB7FFfgSbI3Qp6mqej12Cn4In7vdsQT3u1PzS7RQ-Swf1egJCXFrTLr7YIeaT0qvT9Vi2uWxQV-Ll9s%3D\">science section <\/a>of the company\u2019s website.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this initial Phase 1 study in healthy adult volunteers, AG10 was well-tolerated with no safety signals of potential clinical concern identified. At the highest tested dose, AG10 achieved 100% transthyretin (TTR) stabilization at peak concentration and over 95% TTR stabilization on average at steady state. Serum TTR concentrations, an in vivo indicator of TTR stability, were increased to a greater degree in AG10-treated patients than placebo-treated patients from baseline to Day 12.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe believe that maximizing the level of TTR stabilization will lead to optimal clinical benefit for TTR Amyloidosis (ATTR) patients. This initial human trial demonstrated that AG10 stabilized TTR in established ex vivo assays and increased circulating TTR concentrations,\u201d noted Jonathan C. Fox, M.D., Ph.D., president and chief medical officer of Eidos. \u201cGiven that below normal levels of serum TTR are associated with poorer prognosis in ATTR patients, and stabilization of TTR by protective mutations or small molecule stabilizers increase serum TTR concentrations, we believe that these data provide clinical proof of concept. We are rapidly moving forward with additional studies of AG10 and have already completed enrollment in our Phase 2 trial in patients with symptomatic ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>TTR normally circulates in the blood as a four-part molecule, or tetramer. In ATTR, the tetramer is destabilized by inherited mutation or age-related factors and dissociates into individual monomers, which can aggregate and are deposited as amyloid fibrils in various tissues. AG10, Eidos\u2019 lead product candidate, is designed to target ATTR at its source by stabilizing tetrameric TTR in the blood. Eidos is pursuing AG10 for the treatment of ATTR-CM and ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), both of which are progressive, fatal diseases. The company plans to initiate Phase 3 studies in each indication in the first half of 2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About AG10<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 is an orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric transthyretin, or TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR. AG10 is currently being tested in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic ATTR cardiomyopathy. Top-line results from this trial are expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 was designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a \u201crescue mutation\u201d because it has been shown to prevent ATTR in individuals carrying pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutations in the TTR gene. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in development that has been observed to mimic the \u201csuper-stabilizing\u201d properties of this rescue mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Eidos Therapeutics<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Eidos Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the large and growing unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR).
