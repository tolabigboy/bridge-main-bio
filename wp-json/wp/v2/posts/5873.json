Infigratinib pairs with our ADH1 program, which reads out its Phase 3 next year, to form a high-quality endocrine franchise that we are continuing to build out. With this dataset for achondroplasia in hand, we look forward to July and the next big readout from our pipeline, the 30-month data from our ATTR-CM Phase 3 trial of acoramidis that recently completed last patient last visit. We thank the ATTR-CM patient and physician communities who made this trial possible, and we look forward to sharing the results with you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>BridgeBio\u2019s key programs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><strong>Acoramidis\u00a0(AG10) \u2013 Transthyretin\u00a0(TTR) stabilizer for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM):<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>The Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study has completed last patient last visit.<\/li>\n<li>The Company expects to announce topline registrational data for the month 30 primary endpoint, a hierarchical composite including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, in late July, 2023.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><strong>Low-dose\u00a0infigratinib\u00a0\u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia:<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>In March 2023, the Company reported data from the fifth dosing cohort of the Phase 2 dose-escalation trial PROPEL 2, demonstrating a mean change from baseline in annualized height velocity (AHV) of +3.03 cm\/year for the ten children that have had six-month visits.<\/li>\n<li>80% of the ten children with six-month visits in the fifth cohort were responders, as defined by an increase from baseline AHV of at least 25%.<\/li>\n<li>As a result of treatment, the median absolute AHV reached 7.6 cm\/yr, which is beyond the 99<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0percentile of growth for children living with achondroplasia.<\/li>\n<li>Combined with the previously reported Cohort 4 change from baseline in AHV value of +1.52 cm\/yr, the Cohort 5 data demonstrate a strong dose response for infigratinib.<\/li>\n<li>To date, the study has shown a well-tolerated safety profile, with no study drug related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Cohort 5.

The net increase of $0.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash (current) is primarily attributable to the net proceeds received of $143.0 million from the follow-on public offering, and proceeds from common stock issuance under ESPP and stock option exercises of $2.0 million, partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of $144.3 million.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Operating costs and expenses decreased by $47.4 million to $128.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $175.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The overall decrease in operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the comparative period was mainly due to decreases in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses of $15.5 million resulting from the Company&#8217;s reprioritization of its R&amp;D programs; selling, general and administrative expenses of $12.6 million resulting from its company-wide streamlining of costs; and restructuring, impairment and related charges of $19.3 million since the majority of the restructuring initiatives were initiated in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of the Company&#8217;s restructuring initiative that was started in the first quarter of 2022 are continuing to be realized due to the Company&#8217;s reductions in its operating costs and expenses. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three months ended March 31, 2023 of $3.4 million, were primarily comprised of winding down, exit and other related costs. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the same period in prior year were $22.7 million, were primarily related to impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, severance and employee-related costs, and exit and other related costs. The Company continues to evaluate restructuring alternatives to drive operational changes in business processes, efficiencies, and cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2023 were $23.5 million, of which $11.8 million is included in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses, $11.7 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and nil is included in restructuring, impairment and related charges. Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $24.3 million, of which $8.6 million is included in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses, $14.6 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $1.2 million is included in restructuring, impairment and related charges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStrengthening our balance sheet through our recent $150 million follow-on offering extends our runway into the second half of 2024, and puts us in a strong position to take advantage of our optionality as we head into this summer\u2019s ATTR-CM readout,\u201d said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA, Chief Financial Officer of BridgeBio. \u201cWe will continue to explore ways to extend our runway further through considering potential partnerships and royalty transactions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
