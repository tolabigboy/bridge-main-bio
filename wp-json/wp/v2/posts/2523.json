Bruckner, MD<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About\u00a0Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>DEB is a rare genetic disorder symptomatic from birth that is caused by mutations in the gene for a protein called collagen type VII (C7). The C7 protein is essential for the formation of anchoring fibrils, structures which connect the epidermis and dermis\u2014the uppermost two layers of the skin. Patients with the recessive form of DEB (RDEB) tend to have particularly severe symptoms due to severe insufficiency of functional C7. Symptoms include extreme skin and mucosal fragility that present as recurrent, painful blistering and scarring of the skin, as well as ulcerations of the mouth, tongue and dental caries. In addition to the cutaneous and oral symptoms, severe forms are associated with erosions and scarring of mucous membranes of the eye, esophagus, genitals and anus. Joint contractures, mutilating deformities of hands and feet, malnutrition, growth retardation, recurrent infections and a significantly increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma are also common. There are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies for any form of DEB, and the standard of care focuses on wound and pain management. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Phoenix Tissue Repair and PTR-01<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phoenix Tissue Repair is a\u00a0Boston-based company that is an affiliate of BridgeBio Pharma, and is focused on advancing a novel systemic treatment for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2450293-1&amp;h=4097319985&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fphoenixtissuerepair.com%2F%23ptr-01&amp;a=PTR-01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PTR-01<\/a> is an investigational protein replacement therapy which uses a recombinant collagen type VII (rC7) for the treatment of RDEB.
