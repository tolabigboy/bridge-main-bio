(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, shared new long-term data from its Phase 2 trial in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I\/R9 (LGMD2I\/R9) at the Annual Congress of World Muscle Society (WMS) in Charleston, South Carolina. The new long-term data remains consistent with earlier data from the Phase 2 study showing a well-tolerated safety profile and encouraging preliminary efficacy. Additionally, early changes in glycosylated \u237aDG levels at 3 months appear to be associated with ambulatory improvements at 9 months, providing support for the possible use of glycosylated \u237aDG levels as a surrogate endpoint in the ongoing Phase 3 study for accelerated approval.<\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio presented 21-month results from its ongoing Phase 2 trial, including:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Large (\u226580%), sustained reduction in creatine kinase observed over an extended (up to 21-months) treatment period<\/li>\n<li>Stabilization in\u00a0NSAD scores and ambulatory measures\u00a0observed over 21-months of BBP-418 treatment<\/li>\n<li>BBP-418 continues to be well-tolerated with longer-term treatment<\/li>\n<li>No treatment-related SAEs or dose limiting toxicities observed with 21-months of BBP-418 dosing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThere is a serious unmet need for those with LGMD2I\/R9. The consistent improvement observed in biomarkers as well as stabilization in ambulatory measures are encouraging and help predict the clinical benefit for patients. The data for BBP-418 give me hope that similar results will be carried through in the currently enrolling Phase 3 trial, FORTIFY, for patients with LGMD2I\/R9,\u201d said Amy Harper, M.D., professor in the department of neurology at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and primary investigator of the Phase 2 clinical trial in LGMD2I\/R9.<\/p>\n<p>BridgeBio recently announced the first patient dosed in FORTIFY, its Phase 3 registrational study in patients with LGMD2I\/R9 and is continuing to enroll throughout the U.S. with clinical trial sites planned for Europe and Australia. The Phase 3 FORTIFY registrational study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of BBP-418. FORTIFY has a planned interim analysis at 12 months focused on assessing glycosylated \u03b1DG as a surrogate endpoint to potentially support an accelerated approval. The NSAD and secondary endpoints will be evaluated at 36 months, and results are expected to provide confirmatory clinical data.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo see that our therapy is potentially providing clinical improvements to people who otherwise could be non-ambulatory is deeply heartening for us,\u201d said Douglas Sproule, M.D., M.Sc., chief medical officer of ML Bio Solutions, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing BBP-418 for LGMD2I\/R9. \u201cLGMD2I\/R9 is a severely progressive disease and, inevitably, the weakening of the muscles causes many affected people to become fully dependent on a caregiver. Current treatments for LGMD2I\/R9 are purely supportive. BBP-418 has the potential to be the first disease-modifying orally administered therapy available for patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>More information about FORTIFY, the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of BBP-418 (NCT05775848) can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT05775848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>\u00a0on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2I\/R9 (LGMD2I\/R9)<\/strong><br \/>\nLGMD2I\/R9 is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by partial loss of function mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene, and FKRP mutations impair glycosylation of \u03b1DG, a protein associated with stabilizing muscle cells. Clinical manifestations typically present as a skeletal myopathy affecting the lower and then upper limbs, which is commonly later accompanied by respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle involvement. Patients who harbor a L276I homozygous genotype typically develop disease manifestations during late childhood with progression to loss of independent ambulation (25%), assisted ventilation (10%), and cardiomyopathy (30%) in adulthood. Cardiomyopathy is progressive, with an annual loss of 0.4% of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients with other (non-L276I homozygous) genotypes have an earlier childhood onset with a more severe clinical course, rapid loss of mobility by 20 years of age, more frequent cardiac involvement (60%), and eventual respiratory failure by 30 years of age in nearly all cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma Inc.
