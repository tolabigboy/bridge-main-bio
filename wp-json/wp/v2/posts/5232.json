Achieving simultaneous blood and urine calcium normalization is a challenge for patients with ADH1 due to the limitations of current standard-of-care.\u00a0If approved, encaleret could be the first therapy on the market for ADH1, a condition caused by gain of function variants in the calcium-sensing receptor (<em>CASR<\/em>) gene estimated to be carried by 12,000 individuals in the United States alone.

CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases potentially addressable with AAV gene therapy, with more than 75,000 cases estimated in the United States and European Union. The disease is caused by deleterious mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, leading to lack of endogenous cortisol production. BridgeBio\u2019s AAV5 gene therapy candidate is designed to provide a functional copy of the 21-hydroxylase-encoding gene (CYP21A2) and potentially address many aspects of the disease course.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent pipeline progress and corporate updates:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Stock repurchases:<\/strong> BridgeBio repurchased $148.4 million in BridgeBio common stock under its 2021 Share Repurchase Program, demonstrating the Company\u2019s confidence in the long-term prospects of its pipeline.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>LianBio IPO and partnership: <\/strong>China-based partner LianBio raised $325 million in its initial public offering on November 1.

Over the past three quarters, the Company repurchased $148.4 million in BridgeBio common stock under its 2021 Share Repurchase Program and $50.0 million in BridgeBio common stock in conjunction with its issuance of the 2029 convertible notes, paid $61.3 million for capped call options related to the issuance of its 2029 convertible notes and $35.0 million of regulatory-related milestone payments in connection with its approved products. Earlier during the year, BridgeBio paid $21.3 million to Eidos shareholders who elected for cash settlement in exchange for their Eidos shares and $63.8 million of direct transaction costs arising from the merger with Eidos. These were offset by cash receipts of $731.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of BridgeBio\u2019s 2029 convertible notes, $65.1 million from collaboration partner, Helsinn Group, and $25.0 million in net proceeds from Hercules Capital, Inc. under an amended loan agreement.

The increase in operating costs and expenses was due to an increase in personnel and external costs to support the progression in BridgeBio\u2019s research and development programs and staged buildout of its commercial organization as part of commercial launch readiness activities. This increase in personnel and external costs was offset by $12.2 million in reimbursement of expenses from the cost sharing arrangement recognized under BridgeBio\u2019s License and Collaboration Agreement with Helsinn Group. Stock-based compensation for the quarter was $16.1 million as compared to $17.7 million for the same period in the prior year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Company\u2019s research and development expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented. While BridgeBio experienced some delays in certain of its clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, it continues to adapt in this unprecedented time to enable alternative site, telehealth and home visits, at-home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with its contract manufacturing organizations. The longer-term impact, if any, of COVID-19 on BridgeBio\u2019s operating costs and expenses is currently unknown.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" class=\"wp-image-5240\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_1.1-1024x603.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_1.1-1024x603.png 1024w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_1.1-300x177.png 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_1.1-768x452.png 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_1.1-1536x904.png 1536w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_1.1.png 2038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"692\" class=\"wp-image-5241\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_2.1-1024x692.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_2.1-1024x692.png 1024w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_2.1-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_2.1-768x519.png 768w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_2.1-1536x1038.png 1536w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/BBIO_Earnings_2.1.png 1788w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>\r\n<figcaption><br \/>(1) The condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<br \/><\/strong><br \/>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
