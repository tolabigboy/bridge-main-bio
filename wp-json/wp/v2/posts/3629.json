(NASDAQ: BBIO) and the Canadian Glycomics Network (GlycoNet), a pan-Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence, today announced a collaboration to translate scientific research in glycomics into potential treatments for patients with genetic diseases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to be partnering with GlycoNet, an institution at the forefront of developing carbohydrate-based drugs to address areas of unmet need,\u201d said BridgeBio\u00a0founder and CEO Neil Kumar, Ph.D. \u201cWe understand the clinical benefit research in glycomics could have for certain genetic diseases and by partnering together, we hope to advance potentially life-changing medicines as rapidly as possible.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio will work alongside GlycoNet researchers to identify research programs that may have the potential to become treatments for genetic diseases. BridgeBio will potentially sponsor research programs and support clinical investigation through its licensing and affiliate development model. Genetic disease research has benefitted substantially from the study of glycomics, which relates to the functions of glycans, or sugar, in biological systems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe opportunity to partner with BridgeBio is invaluable,\u201d said GlycoNet CEO Elizabeth Nanak, Ph.D., MBA. \u201cOur joint effort could potentially address areas of unmet needs and get treatments to patients more efficiently. We are hopeful that our network\u2019s expertise in glycomics coupled with BridgeBio\u2019s vigor to advance therapies into the clinic, will improve the quality of life of patients with genetic disorders.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio partners with top academic and research institutions throughout the world, including GlycoNet, to support early, promising research. Today BridgeBio also announced formal partnerships with Brown University, The Lundquist Institute, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Davis and University of California, San Diego \u2013 for a total of 20 partnerships between BridgeBio and leading academic and research institutions to-date.
