(Nasdaq: BBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver meaningful medicines for patients with genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020 and provided an update on the company\u2019s operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio announced a merger agreement last month with Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: EIDX), which is developing acoramidis (formerly AG10), a potential best-in-class transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer for patients with TTR amyloid (ATTR) cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy. With this transaction, BridgeBio intends to fully and formally welcome Eidos back into its vibrant ecosystem of innovation and has agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Eidos it does not already own. The company expects to complete the proposed transaction in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of stockholder approvals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since the company\u2019s last quarterly update, BridgeBio had its first new drug application (NDA) accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Priority Review designation and initiated two new clinical trials, including a Phase 2 trial of encaleret (calcium sensing receptor antagonist) for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), one of BridgeBio\u2019s four core value driver programs. It also entered into collaboration agreements with the Salk Institute and the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to advance the development of new therapies for genetically driven diseases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio held its first-ever R&amp;D Day on September 29, 2020, which focused on the company\u2019s drug engineering platform, its targeted oncology portfolio, and four highlighted programs where clinical data are anticipated in the next 12 to 18 months \u2013 acoramidis for ATTR, low-dose infigratinib (FGFR inhibitor) for achondroplasia, AAV5 gene therapy for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and encaleret for ADH1.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are nearing a significant inflection point as a company as we approach the start of 2021. Our four key programs have critical data readouts within the next year and a half \u2013 in ATTR, achondroplasia, CAH and ADH1. We are progressing 17 ongoing clinical trials and we are preparing for commercialization, to bring our first investigational therapy to patients. There has never been a more exciting moment to be at the forefront of the revolution taking place in genetic medicine,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder Neil Kumar, Ph.D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent pipeline progress and corporate updates:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>BridgeBio and Eidos Therapeutics enter into merger agreement: <\/strong>BridgeBio to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of Eidos it does not already own; agreement unanimously approved by special committee of Eidos\u2019 independent directors. Transaction removes the operational complexity of the current ownership structure and allows BridgeBio to fully invest in opportunities around the investigational drug, acoramidis, including subsequent studies to potentially broaden the evidence for its usage, and accelerate its commercial development using BridgeBio\u2019s established infrastructure. Proposed transaction expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain conditions, including approval by both BridgeBio and Eidos stockholders.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Fosdenopterin (formerly BBP-870\/ORGN001) \u2013 Synthetic cPMP for molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A:<\/strong> FDA acceptance of NDA under Priority Review designation with Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation previously granted.

The net increase in cash balance of $133.6 million reflects $537.0 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (2027 Notes), $24.1 million in net proceeds received from Eidos\u2019 at-the-market issuance of shares, offset by payment of $75.0 million to repurchase BridgeBio shares in capped call transactions in connection with the issuance of our 2027 Notes, $49.3 million payment related to capped call option, $13.3 million payments of interest on our debts, and $289.9 million primarily related to operating expenses.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $130.2 million compared to our balance as of June 30, 2020, which was $840.9 million.

The increases in operating expenses of $46.8 million and $140.8 million during the respective periods were attributable to the increase in external-related costs and increase in headcount to support the progression in our research and development programs, including our increasing research pipelines, and overall growth of our operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $3.5 million when compared to the operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 of $124.6 million. Our research and development expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global outbreak of COVID-19 for the periods presented. While we experienced some initial delays in certain of our clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, we continue to adapt in this unprecedented time to enable alternative site, telehealth and home visits, at home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with our contract manufacturing organizations. The longer-term impact of COVID-19 on our operating expenses is currently unknown.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"742\" height=\"646\" class=\"wp-image-2900\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Q3-image-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Q3-image-1-1.jpg 742w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Q3-image-1-1-300x261.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"727\" height=\"694\" class=\"wp-image-2901\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Q3-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Q3-image-2.jpg 727w, https:\/\/bridgebio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Q3-image-2-300x286.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio\u00a0Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to discover, create, test and deliver life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
