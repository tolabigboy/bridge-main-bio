(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced the Company\u2019s novel validated muscle tissue-based bioassay, which measures the amount of glycosylated \u237aDG in patients with LGMD2I, at the MDA 2023 Annual Meeting. Additionally, BridgeBio shared updated results at Month 15 for its Phase 2 clinical trial and the design for its pivotal Phase 3 study for patients with LGMD2I. BridgeBio will host an investor call with Jeffrey Rosenfeld, M.D., Ph.D., a specialist in neuromuscular medicine and professor of neurology at Loma Linda University School of Medicine on Tuesday, March 21 at 8:30 am ET to discuss the results shared at the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The novel bioassay was developed by BridgeBio to measure the amount of glycosylated \u237aDG, and to evaluate the impact of BBP-418 treatment. When deficient, glycosylated \u237aDG is the direct cause of muscle breakdown in LGMD2I. The bioassay allowed the Company to evaluate natural history and Phase 2 data to inform the Phase 3 study design. Highlights of the results include:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Development of a novel, validated, quantitative method to measure glycosylated \u237aDG in muscle<\/li>\n<li>Observation of ~90% reduction in glycosylated \u237aDG in muscle biopsies from patients with LGMD2I compared to healthy individuals<\/li>\n<li>Higher glycosylated \u237aDG in L276I\/L276I homozygous patients (~11%) who are characterized by a milder clinical phenotype than other fukutin-related protein (FKRP) genotypes (~5%)<\/li>\n<li>Stable glycosylated \u237aDG levels in untreated patients with LGMD2I over ~6-12 months<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThe \u237aDG bioassay offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the core causative step leading to muscle cell breakdown and muscle weakness in LGMD2I. There is a serious unmet need for patients living with this progressive and debilitating condition, and I am encouraged by the very promising results from this therapy, especially considering the relevance of the \u237aDG bioassay. The profound effects on glycosylated-\u03b1DG observed in the Phase 2 trial, alongside the encouraging trends on clinical endpoints, including North Star Assessment for Dysferlinopathy (NSAD) and ambulatory measures has made me especially optimistic for a phase 3 trial,\u201d said Jeffrey Rosenfeld, M.D., Ph.D.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, BridgeBio presented 15-month results from its ongoing Phase 2 trial and the design of its registration-enabling Phase 3 study. Phase 2 study results showed:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Increased glycosylation of \u237aDG was observed following treatment initiation with BBP-418, with an approximate doubling of glycosylated \u237aDG at 3 months which was sustained over 15 months<\/li>\n<li>Greater than 70% reduction in CK sustained at 15 months<\/li>\n<li>Improvements from baseline in NSAD test scores and ambulatory measures at 15 months<\/li>\n<li>No treatment-related serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities were observed with BBP-418<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The planned Phase 3 registrational study in patients with LGMD2I (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT05775848\">NCT05775848<\/a>)<u><\/u>\u00a0\u00a0is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind two-arm study comparing the effect of BBP-418 to standard of care. Key measures include glycosylated-\u03b1DG using the validated bioassay and changes in NSAD scores and ambulatory measures over a 36-month period.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLGMD2I is highly progressive and, inevitably, the severity of the disease causes people to become fully dependent on a caregiver, requiring a wheelchair or even ventilation assistance. Our novel bioassay enables us to assess whether our therapy is working and signifies, through our Phase 2 data, that the effect of BBP-418 treatment on restoration of glycosylation of \u03b1DG is sustained over time. At 15 months, we are continuing to see consistent improvements in clinical endpoints from the Phase 2 trial such as increased NSAD score, increased 10-meter walk test velocity, and reduced time to complete 100-meter timed test compared to baseline; as opposed to the declines observed in these endpoints in the natural history population. Based upon these results, we are embarking on a registration-enabling Phase 3 study in mid-2023, which we hope confirms a therapeutic benefit for patients,\u201d said Douglas Sproule, M.D., M.Sc., chief medical officer of ML Bio Solutions, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing BBP-418 for LGMD2I.<\/p>\n<p>BBP-418 is designed to supply supraphysiological levels of the ribitol substrate upstream of the mutant FKRP enzyme to help drive residual activity of the enzyme to glycosylate \u03b1DG, with the goal of stabilizing muscle cells during contraction, and potentially halting further muscle damage. If approved, BridgeBio believes BBP-418 could be the first approved orally administered therapy for the treatment of patients with LGMD2I.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Webcast Information<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the LGMD2I program updates shared at MDA on Tuesday, March 21 at 8:30 am ET.

Clinical manifestations typically present as a skeletal myopathy affecting the lower and then upper limbs, which is commonly later accompanied by respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle involvement. Patients who harbor a homozygous genotype typically develop disease manifestations during late childhood with progression to loss of independent ambulation (25%), assisted ventilation (5%), and cardiomyopathy (10%) in adulthood. Cardiomyopathy is progressive, with an annual loss of 0.4% of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients with heterozygous genotypes have an earlier childhood onset with a more severe clinical course, rapid loss of mobility by 20 years of age, more frequent cardiac involvement (25%), and eventual respiratory failure by 30 years of age in nearly all cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma Inc.
