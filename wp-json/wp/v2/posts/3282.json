Due to defective FKRP enzyme function, muscle cells of patients affected by LGMD2i\u00a0lack the structural integrity that is provided by fully glycosylated\u00a0\u03b1DG protein. This leads to chronic muscle injury and loss, muscle weakness and disability.\u00a0Many affected\u00a0patients\u00a0ultimately\u00a0lose their ability to walk,\u00a0and some\u00a0develop a need for ventilatory support or\u00a0die from heart failure.\u00a0Currently,\u00a0there are no disease-modifying therapies for\u00a0people with\u00a0LGMD2i.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-418 is designed to bypass the metabolic defect in LGMD2i\u00a0by\u00a0providing the\u00a0FKRP\u00a0enzyme\u00a0with precursor sugar molecules\u00a0that\u00a0supplement\u00a0the\u00a0body\u2019s\u00a0natural sugars\u00a0used by FKRP\u00a0to glycosylate the\u00a0\u03b1DG\u00a0protein\u00a0on muscle cells. BBP-418 represents a novel substrate\u00a0rescue\u00a0approach\u00a0with the potential to improve muscle strength and function.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 2 trial is expected to enroll up to 16 patients with a genetically-confirmed diagnosis of LGMD2i. In addition to safety, key efficacy measurements include changes in muscle \u03b1DG glycosylation levels, and changes in functional measures including 10 meter walk and North Star for Dysferlinopathy (NSAD).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe start of our Phase 2 trial is a key milestone in our effort to develop a safe and efficacious therapy for patients with\u00a0LGMD2i\u00a0who lack treatment options,\u201d said\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Douglas Sproule, M.D. M.Sc.,\u00a0Chief\u00a0Medical\u00a0Officer\u00a0of ML Bio\u00a0Solutions.\u00a0\u201cThis trial launch is an outgrowth of our strong partnership with the GRASP-LGMD consortium based at Virginia Commonwealth University, where we are currently enrolling a lead-in study to define\u00a0LGMD2i-specific biomarkers and functional endpoints.
