(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u202fa commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced that it will host an investor call on March 14, 2022, at 8:00 AM ET to discuss data from its Phase 2 study of BBP-418 in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i (LGMD2i). The results will be featured at the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) 2022 Annual Meeting, taking place in Nashville, Tennessee on March 13 \u2013 16, 2022.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With approximately 7,000 patients in the U.S. and European Union with potentially treatable mutations, LGMD2i is an inherited autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by partial loss of function mutations in fukutin-related protein (FKRP) which results in hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1DG). BBP-418 is being investigated to function as a substrate supplementation therapy that is hypothesized to drive glycosylation of \u03b1DG and target the root cause of the disease. If the development program is successful, we believe BBP-418 could be the first approved therapy for the treatment of patients with LGMD2i.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Focused execution is BridgeBio\u2019s top priority as it advances its pipeline of high-quality programs to help patients as quickly as possible. The Company remains dedicated to strategically developing and delivering transformative medicines for genetic diseases and cancers with unmet need.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Webcast Information<\/strong><br \/>BridgeBio will host an investor call and simultaneous webcast to discuss Phase 2 data for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i on March 14, 2022\u00a0at\u00a08:00 AM ET.

Cardiomyopathy is progressive, with an annual loss of 0.4% of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients with heterozygous genotypes have an earlier childhood onset with a more severe clinical course, rapid loss of mobility by 20 years of age, more frequent cardiac involvement (25%), and eventual respiratory failure by 30 years of age in nearly all cases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma Inc.
