(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced interim Phase 1 data from healthy volunteers, supporting the development of BBP-671 for potential treatment of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) and organic acidemias. The data are being shared in a scientific poster session at the Pan American Parkinson and Movement Disorders (PAS) Congress on May 26, 2022, in Miami, FL.<\/p>\n<p>BBP-671 is an investigational oral therapy designed to increase coenzyme-A (CoA) levels by allosterically modulating pantothenate kinases, key enzymes in the CoA biosynthesis pathway. BBP-671 is being developed as a potential therapy for diseases in which CoA metabolism is deficient, including PKAN, propionic acidemia (PA), and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).<\/p>\n<p>PKAN is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressively debilitating symptoms that begin in early childhood, including dystonia, rigidity, bradykinesia, dysphagia, visual impairment and dementia. PA and MMA are rare metabolic disorders caused by mutations in enzymes that participate in amino acid metabolism leading to life-threatening metabolic decompensations, as well as long-term complications involving multiple organ systems, including the heart, pancreas, kidney, liver and brain. PKAN, PA and MMA are rare diseases affecting an estimated 7,000 patients in the United States and European Union collectively. BridgeBio believes these initial findings from the Phase 1 study demonstrate target engagement and proof of mechanism of BBP-671 provided by evidence that BBP-671 can cross the blood brain barrier.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGiven the severe unmet need for these patients, we were very encouraged by the elevation in whole blood acetyl-CoA in response to BBP-671 administration, which we believe is the first time this has been demonstrated in humans with a therapeutic intervention,\u201d said Agnieszka Jurecka, M.D., Ph.D., vice president of clinical development at BridgeBio. \u201cIt was also critical to establish that BBP-671 crosses the blood brain barrier since PKAN is a neurodegenerative disease and PA and MMA patients suffer frequent neurological complications. We are pleased to achieve this important milestone and bring BBP-671 one step closer to patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first-in-human Phase 1 study of BBP-671 in a total of 77 healthy volunteers was designed to provide single- and multiple dose safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to support future development of BBP-671. Single and multiple ascending oral doses of BBP-671 were administered in a double-blind manner to six single and four multiple dose cohorts consisting of up to eight healthy volunteers per cohort. The data from the first part of the Phase 1 study included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>BBP-671 was detected in healthy volunteer plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests BBP-671 is entering into the brain<\/li>\n<li>BBP-671 increased whole blood acetyl-CoA levels, which BridgeBio believes is the first time a therapeutic intervention has demonstrated this and demonstrates target engagement and proof of mechanism of the drug<\/li>\n<li>BBP 671 was generally well-tolerated following oral dosing in healthy volunteers with no serious adverse events observed<\/li>\n<li>Mild treatment-related emergent adverse events included headache, abdominal pain and nausea (5%, 1.7% and 1.7%, respectively, of all individuals treated in single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose with BBP-671)<\/li>\n<li>Asymptomatic neutropenia was observed in three individuals with repeat dosing of BBP-671; all returned to within normal limits within a few days without any sequelae upon cessation of therapy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on these positive data, BridgeBio intends to move forward with the second part of its Phase 1 clinical study in patients with PA and MMA in the second half of 2022, as well as initiate a pivotal Phase 2\/3 clinical study in PKAN in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>More information about the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of BBP-671 (study number NCT04836494) can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04836494?term=coa+therapeutics&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\">here<\/a> on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
