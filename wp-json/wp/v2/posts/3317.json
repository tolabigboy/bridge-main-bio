(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio or the Company), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver meaningful medicines for patients with genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2020 and provided an update on the Company\u2019s operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since its last quarterly update, BridgeBio completed its acquisition of Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Nasdaq: EIDX) (Eidos) in January 2021, acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Eidos common stock that BridgeBio did not already own. The merger returns BridgeBio and Eidos to a single unified company and is intended to allow BridgeBio to unlock the full potential of acoramidis, a potential best-in-class therapy for patients with transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR).\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Acoramidis for ATTR is one of BridgeBio\u2019s four core value driver programs along with encaleret (CaSR inhibitor) for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), low-dose infigratinib (FGFR inhibitor) for achondroplasia, and BBP-631, an AAV5 gene therapy for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).\u00a0Pivotal or potential proof-of-concept data is anticipated\u00a0for each of the programs by the end of 2021 or early 2022.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio had its second NDA accepted by the FDA and is preparing for its first two commercial launches this year, pending FDA approval, for infigratinib for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or bile duct cancer, as a second-line or later therapy in patients with advanced and\/or metastatic CCA with FGFR2 fusions or translocations, and for fosdenopterin for the treatment of MoCD Type A, an ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic disorder that results in severe and largely irreversible neurological injury for infants and children. Additionally, the Company initiated two new clinical trials and progressed 17 additional ongoing trials. BridgeBio established a joint venture with Maze Therapeutics to advance precision medicine to treat cardiovascular disease and entered into a partnership agreement with the University of California, San Francisco to drive the advancement of academic innovations in genetically driven diseases into potential therapeutics for patients.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are hopeful that the scientific innovation we are pursuing at scale begins to translate into meaningful gains for patients this year. We are on track to deliver near-term pivotal or potential proof-of-concept data in our four core value driver programs. The successful completion of our acquisition of Eidos allows us to further focus BridgeBio\u2019s clinical and commercialization engine on acoramidis for patients suffering from ATTR,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder, Neil Kumar, Ph.D. \u201cWe are also starting the year in a strong financial position following our recent debt financing, which enables us to progress the 19 ongoing clinical trials and over 30 programs in our pipeline, as well as to prepare for the anticipated launch of our first two drugs, if approved.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Major milestones anticipated in 2021 or early 2022 for BridgeBio\u2019s four core value drivers:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Acoramidis\u00a0(AG10) \u2013 TTR stabilizer for ATTR-CM:\u00a0Topline results from Part A of the ATTRibute-CM trial are expected in late 2021 or early 2022 and from Part B in 2023. If Part A is successful, BridgeBio expects to submit an application for regulatory approval of acoramidis in 2022. ATTR is a form of amyloidosis caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein. It is estimated to affect more than 400,000 people in the United States and the European Union and is largely undiagnosed today.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Encaleret\u00a0\u2013\u00a0calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)\u00a0inhibitor for ADH1:\u00a0Early results from an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept study will be shared at the Endocrine Society\u2019s 2021 Annual Meeting (ENDO) on March 20<sup>th<\/sup>. If the development program is successful, encaleret could be the first approved therapy for ADH1, a condition caused by gain of function variants in the CaSR gene estimated to be carried by 12,000 individuals in the United States alone.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Low-dose\u00a0infigratinib\u00a0\u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia:\u00a0Initial data from the ongoing Phase 2 dose ranging study are expected in the second half of 2021. Achondroplasia is the most common form of genetic short stature and one of the most common genetic diseases, with 55,000 cases in the United States and European Union. Low-dose infigratinib is the only known product candidate in development for achondroplasia that targets the disease at its genetic source and the only orally administered product candidate in clinical-stage development.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>BBP-631 \u2013 AAV5 gene therapy candidate for CAH:\u00a0Initiation of a first-in-human Phase 1\/2 study is expected in the second half of 2021, with initial data anticipated in late 2021 or early 2022. CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases potentially addressable with AAV gene therapy, with more than 75,000 cases in the United States and European Union. The disease is caused by deleterious mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, leading to lack of endogenous cortisol production. BridgeBio\u2019s AAV5 gene therapy candidate is designed to provide a functional copy of the 21-hydroxylase-encoding gene (CYP21A2) and potentially address many aspects of the disease course.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent pipeline progress and corporate updates:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Completed acquisition of Eidos Therapeutics in January 2021, acquiring of all of the outstanding shares of Eidos common stock that BridgeBio did not already own.

The decrease in cash reflects $2.0 million payments of interests on our debts and $109.6 million primarily relating to operating expenses, partially offset by a receipt of $8.0 million in upfront payment under the license agreement with LianBio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Operating Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Operating expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 were $127.6 million and $482.7 million, respectively, as compared to $92.5 million and $306.8 million, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year. The increases in operating expenses of $35.1 million and $175.9 million during the respective periods were attributable to the increase in external-related costs, including manufacturing validation activities for our late-stage programs, and increase in personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees to support the progression in our research and development programs, including our increasing research pipelines, and overall growth of our operations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $0.5 million when compared to the operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020 of $128.1 million.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our research and development expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global outbreak of COVID-19 for the periods presented. While we experienced some delays in certain of our clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, we continue to adapt in this unprecedented time to enable alternative site, telehealth and home visits, at-home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with our contract manufacturing organizations.
