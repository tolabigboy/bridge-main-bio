(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, presented updated six month results from Cohort 5 in PROPEL2, a Phase 2 trial of the investigational therapy infigratinib in children with achondroplasia, demonstrating a continued potentially best-in-class efficacy and safety profile at the Endocrine Society (ENDO) 2023 Annual Conference. Infigratinib is an oral small molecule designed to inhibit FGFR3 and target achondroplasia at its source.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe safety and efficacy results seen in these Phase 2 data are extremely promising and suggest that infigratinib has the potential to be the first effective oral therapy to improve growth, enhance functionality and decrease complications in children with achondroplasia. We consider that the cumulative increases in growth velocity will translate to improvements for the medical and functional complications of achondroplasia, which will be impactful for those seeking treatment within the community,\u201d said Dr. Ravi Savarirayan, M.D., Ph.D., clinical geneticist and leader of the molecular therapies research group at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia and the global lead investigator for PROPEL2.<\/p>\n<p>The updated six month results for 12 patients in Cohort 5 (0.25mg\/kg\/once daily) include:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>The mean increase from baseline in AHV is significant and robust at +3.38 cm\/year<\/li>\n<li>83% of the children were responders, based on the criteria defined for the study with a change from baseline AHV of at least 25%, with a mean of +4.08 cm\/year<\/li>\n<li>Preliminary data suggests the Cohort 5 dose level may be having a positive effect on the upper and lower body segment ratio<\/li>\n<li>Changes in linear growth are supported by an increase in collagen X marker (CXM), an independent, real-time biomarker of bone growth, supporting a true biologic effect from infigratinib<\/li>\n<li>This increase in growth translated into an increase in z-score of +0.29 standard deviation scores compared to achondroplasia growth charts<\/li>\n<li>Treatment has been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs), or treatment emergent AEs that led to treatment discontinuation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition to the Cohort 5 data being shared, the Phase 2 data from the previous four cohorts was also discussed during the presentation. Treatment in all cohorts has been well tolerated with no SAEs or any AEs requiring treatment discontinuation. The AEs most frequently reported are considered common conditions in the pediatric population, particularly in children with achondroplasia. The Phase 2 trial was designed to identify the dose of infigratinib that will be explored in the Phase 3 trial.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am encouraged by the consistent results we are continuing to see in AHV. Our data also presents the opportunity for us to move forward quickly in initiating a Phase 3 clinical trial. We appreciate the ongoing support and partnership by the physicians, community advocates, children, and families in this study and look forward to continuing to explore the benefits of infigratinib not only in growth, but in other outcomes meaningful to the community,\u201d said Daniela Rogoff, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president of clinical development for the skeletal dysplasias program at BridgeBio.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the positive results to date, BridgeBio is underway in enrolling children in the run-in for a Phase 3 trial.

Additionally, the Company expects to initiate clinical development for infigratinib in hypochondroplasia, a skeletal dysplasia related to achondroplasia and similarly driven by FGFR3 gain-of-function variants, in the coming months. Infigratinib has IP protection out to at least 2041.<\/p>\n<p>At ENDO 2023, BridgeBio also shared nonclinical results from studies in skeletal dysplasias as well as updates from its autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) program, including positive 18 month data from its ongoing Phase 2 study of encaleret in ADH1 and its sponsored hypoparathyroidism genetic testing program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Achondroplasia<\/strong><br \/>\nAchondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature, affecting approximately 55,000 people in the United States (US) and European Union (EU), including up to 10,000 children and adolescents with open growth plates. Achondroplasia impacts overall health and quality of life, leading to medical complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. The condition is uniformly caused by an activating mutation in FGFR3.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma Inc.
