(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced a non-exclusive clinical collaboration with Amgen Inc. (Amgen) to evaluate the combination of BBP-398, a potentially best-in-class SHP2 inhibitor with LUMAKRAS\u00ae (sotorasib), a KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors with the <em>KRAS<\/em> G12C mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 1\/2 study will include a dose escalation period followed by dose expansion and optimization, and is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of BBP-398 in combination with LUMAKRAS. Under the terms of the non-exclusive collaboration, BridgeBio will sponsor the study and Amgen will provide a global supply of LUMAKRAS.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-398 is a potent small-molecular inhibitor of SHP2 developed in collaboration with The University of Texas MD\u00a0Anderson Cancer Center\u2019s Therapeutics Discovery division. SHP2 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that links growth factor, cytokine and integrin signaling with the downstream RAS\/ERK MAPK pathway to regulate cellular proliferation and survival. By combining SHP2 inhibition with KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibition in patients with the <em>KRAS<\/em> G12C mutation, there is potential that the investigational combination could prevent oncogenesis and overactive cellular proliferation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cOveractivity of the MAPK pathway is a significant cause of many types of difficult-to-treat cancers and by combining these two agents, we aim to reduce the oncogenic potential of tumor cells,\u201d said Frank McCormick, Ph.D., chairman of oncology at BridgeBio. \u201cBuilding on our collaborations with Bristol Myers Squibb and LianBio, we are excited to be working with Amgen on this new collaboration. By harnessing the power of BBP-398 as a potentially best-in-class SHP2 inhibitor with LUMAKRAS, we are hopeful that we will be able to provide substantial relief for cancer patients in need. We will continue to pursue additional collaborations that we believe hold promise for patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>KRAS<\/em> mutations occur in approximately 17% of malignant solid tumors. BBP-398, as a monotherapy or in combination with other targeted therapies, could potentially be a promising therapy for patients with the <em>KRAS<\/em> G12C mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio is currently advancing its Phase 1 clinical trial of its SHP2 inhibitor, BBP-398, in patients with solid tumors driven by mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including <em>RAS<\/em> and receptor tyrosine kinase genes. BBP-398 is part of BridgeBio\u2019s growing precision oncology pipeline and is one of 14 programs in the broader portfolio that are being advanced in the clinic or commercial setting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BBP-398<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"has-inline-color has-dark-gray-color\">BBP-398 is a potentially best-in-class SHP2 inhibitor. Earlier this year, BridgeBio entered a non-exclusive, co-funded clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of BBP-398 with OPDIVO<strong>\u00ae<\/strong><\/span> (nivolumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors with <em>KRAS<\/em> mutations. BridgeBio previously also entered into a strategic collaboration with LianBio for clinical development and commercialization of BBP-398 in combination with various agents in solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer in mainland China and other major Asian markets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
