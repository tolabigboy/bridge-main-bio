By that metric, our most significant accomplishment of the quarter was the approval of TRUSELTIQ\u2122 (infigratinib) for patients with cholangiocarcinoma\u00a0&#8211; our second FDA approval as a company and our first for a cancer treatment. All drug approvals are a team effort that extends far beyond BridgeBio. We thank the patient community, physicians, scientists and advocates for their commitment and drive. They made this approval possible,\u201d said BridgeBio founder and CEO Neil Kumar, Ph.D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Major milestones anticipated in the next 12 months for BridgeBio\u2019s four core value drivers:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Acoramidis\u00a0(AG10) \u2013 Transthyretin\u00a0(TTR) stabilizer for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM):\u00a0Topline results from Part A of the ATTRibute-CM trial are expected in late 2021 and from Part B in 2023. The primary endpoint at Part A is the change from baseline in a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) in trial participants receiving acoramidis or placebo after 12 months. In a previous Phase 3 study in ATTR-CM patients, participants receiving the current standard of care treatment demonstrated a decline in 6MWD of approximately 25 meters (m) from an average baseline of 351m at 12 months.<sup>1<\/sup>\u00a0From a comparable average 6MWD baseline in the ATTRibute-CM study, the Company is seeking to more potently halt the observed decline in acoramidis-treated participants. As a reminder, healthy elderly adults typically decline only 7m in 12 months.<sup>2<\/sup> If the change from baseline in 6MWD in Part A is highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01), BridgeBio expects to submit an application for regulatory approval of acoramidis in 2022 to the FDA.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Encaleret\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)\u00a0inhibitor for ADH1: Received Fast Track designation from the FDA.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/a2cb4e3b-9442-476f-91d8-f50bb3561522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Early results from an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept study<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0shared at the Endocrine Society\u2019s 2021 Annual Meeting (ENDO) in March 2021 showed normalization of blood calcium and urine calcium in 6 of 6 (100%) ADH1 participants. Additional data from the ongoing study are expected in the second half of 2021. If the development program is successful, encaleret could be the first approved therapy for ADH1, a condition caused by gain of function variants in the CaSR gene estimated to be carried by 12,000 individuals in the United States alone.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Low-dose\u00a0infigratinib\u00a0\u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia:\u00a0Initial data from the ongoing Phase 2 dose ranging study are expected in the first half of 2022. Achondroplasia is the most common form of genetic short stature and one of the most common genetic diseases, with a prevalence of greater than 55,000 cases in the United States and European Union. Low-dose infigratinib is the only known product candidate in clinical development for achondroplasia that is designed to target the disease at its genetic source and the only orally administered product candidate in clinical-stage development.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>BBP-631 \u2013 AAV5 gene therapy candidate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): Received Fast Track designation from the FDA in May 2021.\u00a0Investigational New Drug (IND) application cleared by the FDA and site activation for initiation of a first-in-human Phase 1\/2 study is ongoing, with initial data anticipated in mid-2022. CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases potentially addressable with AAV gene therapy, with more than 75,000 cases estimated in the United States and European Union. The disease is caused by deleterious mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, leading to lack of endogenous cortisol production. BridgeBio\u2019s AAV5 gene therapy candidate is designed to provide a functional copy of the 21-hydroxylase-encoding gene (CYP21A2) and potentially address many aspects of the disease course.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Recent pipeline progress and corporate updates:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>FDA approval received for TRUSELTIQ\u2122 (infigratinib) under the accelerated approval program for the treatment of patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. TRUSELTIQ is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR. In the pivotal trial of patients with advanced, unresectable CCA, an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis, TRUSELTIQ led to cases of tumor shrinkage. BridgeBio is eligible to receive upfront, regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to approximately $2.45 billion USD through its strategic collaboration with Helsinn Group to co-develop and commercialize infigratinib in certain oncology indications.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Fast Track designation received from the FDA for BBP-812, BridgeBio\u2019s AAV9 gene therapy candidate for Canavan disease.

The net increase in balance of $291.3 million is attributed to $731.4 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes) in January 2021 and $30.2 million in upfront payment and reimbursements received in connection with our License and Collaboration Agreement with Helsinn Healthcare S.A. and Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc. (collectively, Helsinn) , which became effective in April 2021, and $25.0 million in net proceeds from our Amended Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. in April 2021 (the Amended Hercules Term Loan). The cash receipts were partially offset by a $61.3 million payment related to capped call options and a $50.0 million payment to repurchase shares of BridgeBio common stock, both in relation to the issuance of our 2029 Notes. In connection with our acquisition of Eidos Therapeutics, Inc. (Eidos) in January 2021, we paid $63.6 million in direct transaction costs and $21.3 million to Eidos stockholders who elected cash settlement. The remaining change of $299.1 million primarily related to payments of interest and operating costs and expenses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $102.9 million compared to our balance as of March 31, 2021, which was $1,001.3 million. The decrease in cash is mainly due to cash used primarily related to our operating costs and expenses and partially offset by the payments received from Helsinn and proceeds from the Amended Hercules Term Loan as also discussed above.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Revenues<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were $54.0 million and $54.5 million, respectively. Our revenues mainly include upfront and milestone payments arising from the License and Collaboration Agreement with Helsinn and the License Agreement between our affiliate Navire Pharma, Inc. and LianBio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Operating costs and expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were $148.0 million and $316.0 million, respectively, as compared to $124.6 million and $227.1 million for the same periods in the prior year. The increases in operating costs and expenses of $23.4 million and $88.9 million, respectively, during the periods were attributable to the increase in personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees to support the progression in our research and development programs, including our increasing research pipelines, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation related to the achievement of various performance-based milestone compensation arrangements tied to regulatory and development milestones. Stock-based compensation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was $32.0 million and $66.9 million, respectively, as compared to $18.4 million and $28.6 million for the same periods in the prior year. Amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 reflect the reduction in operating costs and expenses arising from cost sharing recognized under our License and Collaboration Agreement with Helsinn. Our research and development expenses have not been significantly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic for the periods presented. While we experienced some delays in certain of our clinical enrollment and trial commencement activities, we continue to adapt in this unprecedented time to enable alternative site, telehealth and home visits, at-home drug delivery, as well as mitigation strategies with our contract manufacturing organizations. The longer-term impact, if any, of COVID-19 on our operating costs and expenses is currently unknown.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4877\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Q2-PR_Screenshot-2021-08-04-180927-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4879\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/bbio-q2-2021-earning-report-image_Screenshot-2021-08-04-181115-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers.
