The companion diagnostic, which will include detection of activating FGFR2 fusions, is expected to be incorporated into FoundationOne\u00aeCDx, Foundation Medicine&#8217;s FDA-approved comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay for all solid tumors that includes multiple companion diagnostics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;While targeted therapies have transformed the treatment landscape for multiple cancers, such as lung cancer, cholangiocarcinoma has not yet benefitted from these advances,&#8221; noted Susan Moran, M.D., M.S.C.E., chief medical officer of QED Therapeutics. &#8220;Given infigratinib&#8217;s demonstrated promise in FGFR2 fusion-driven cholangiocarcinoma, a companion diagnostic is critical to help physicians reliably identify which patients might be candidates for treatment.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>About QED Therapeutics<\/h5>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>QED Therapeutics, a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine for FGFR-driven diseases. Our lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown meaningful clinical activity in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED is also evaluating infigratinib in preclinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia and other skeletal dysplasias. We plan to conduct further clinical trials to evaluate infigratinib in additional FGFR-driven tumor types and rare disorders.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10, 2018 \/PRNewswire\/ \u2014 QED Therapeutics today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Foundation Medicine to develop a companion diagnostic for infigratinib, an FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with cholangiocarcinoma.
