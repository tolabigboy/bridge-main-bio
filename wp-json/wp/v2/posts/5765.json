(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today presented promising pharmacodynamic, tolerability and preliminary functional efficacy data from the first three participants dosed in CAN<em>aspire<\/em>, its Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of BBP-812, an investigational intravenous (IV) adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease. An update on the CAN<em>inform\u00a0<\/em>natural history study, which continues to enroll new participants globally, was also presented. Canavan disease is an ultra-rare and fatal disease with no approved therapies.<\/p>\n<p>New data from the third CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u00a0participant are consistent with the first two treated children:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>At Month 3 post-treatment, Participant 3 showed:\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>89% reduction of NAA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)<\/li>\n<li>45% reduction in urine NAA<\/li>\n<li>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) NAA data are not yet available<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, Participant 2 showed a continued decline in urine NAA at Month 6 with an 85% decrease compared to pre-treatment.<\/p>\n<p>In June, BridgeBio Pharma reported<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>At Month 6 post-treatment, Participant 1 showed:\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>77% reduction of NAA in CSF<\/li>\n<li>15% reduction in NAA in brain white matter by MRS imaging<\/li>\n<li>45% reduction in urine NAA<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>At Month 3 post-treatment, Participant 2 showed:\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>89% reduction of NAA in CSF<\/li>\n<li>53% reduction in NAA in brain white matter by MRS imaging<\/li>\n<li>81% reduction in urine NAA<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No additional brain or CSF NAA data are available for Participants 1 and 2 since the last announcement given the study schedule for MRS imaging and lumbar punctures. IV infusions of BBP-812 have been well-tolerated by all 3 participants with no reported treatment-related serious adverse events.<\/p>\n<p>The consistent reductions in CSF and brain NAA observed to date continue to support the ability of BBP-812 to reach the central nervous system and express active aspartoacylase (ASPA) enzyme.\u00a0<strong>&#8220;<\/strong>The most critical biomarker, in my mind, is NAA. Reduction in NAA levels, whether in the brain, CSF fluids, or in the urine, may indicate a sign of improvement because the gene missing in Canavan disease directly leads to accumulation of NAA. So, showing that NAA is decreasing is very important,\u201d said Guangping Gao, Ph.D., scientific founder of Aspa Therapeutics, the BridgeBio Gene Therapy affiliate company developing the gene therapy for Canavan disease.<\/p>\n<p>The data, presented today in two posters (linked\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com%2Fstatic-files%2F77540b6f-c050-4b71-be07-bfa8f0fead39&amp;data=05%7C01%7Chcondon%40origintx.com%7Cb3d18e83bb4740f4a1f308daac997607%7Cb2fed444408c4e80892a6f79fc99ebad%7C1%7C0%7C638012072532871860%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=4O9nnhPdrk3v7kP22kxjY9IeGnpvvcSSnhJLgy%2Fx4i4%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\/static-files\/562673b7-2764-45a5-a14b-096e034032c8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here<\/a>) at the 2022 Child Neurology Society conference, combined with early signs of clinical change\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/news\/bridgebio-pharma-announces-early-positive-data-for-bbp-812-its-investigational-aav9-gene-therapy-for-canavan-disease\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">previously noted<\/a>\u00a0by Dr. Florian Eichler, Principal Investigator in the Aspa gene therapy trial, are encouraging signs that the therapy may be working as intended.<\/p>\n<p>Both studies continue to enroll and a broader Phase 1\/2 data readout, including safety and efficacy findings and updates on the pharmacodynamic data is expected in 1H 2023.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are encouraged by the sustained reduction in key biomarkers for this condition, a novel observation in the treatment of Canavan disease, and by the early reports of improvement in function we are hearing from our investigator.

Each eligible patient will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of BBP-812. The primary outcomes of the study are safety, as well as change from baseline of urine and central nervous system N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels. Motor function and development will also be assessed.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the CAN<em>aspire<\/em>\u202ftrial, visit\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/treatcanavan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong><u>TreatCanavan.com<\/u><\/strong><\/a>\u202for ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04998396).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BBP-812<\/strong><br \/>\nBBP-812 is an investigational AAV9 gene therapy for Canavan disease. Using AAV gene therapy, BridgeBio seeks to deliver functional copies of the\u202f<em>ASPA\u202f<\/em>gene throughout the body and into the brain, potentially correcting the disease at its source. Preclinical proof-of-concept results have shown the approach restores survival and normal motor function in Canavan disease models. BBP-812 was granted Fast Track Designation, Rare Pediatric Drug Designation, and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. BBP-812 was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Canavan Disease<\/strong><br \/>\nAffecting approximately 1,000 children in the United States and European Union, Canavan disease is an ultra-rare, disabling and fatal disease with no approved therapy. Most children are not able to meet developmental milestones, are unable to crawl, walk, sit or talk, and die at a young age. The disease is caused by an inherited mutation of the\u202f<em>ASPA<\/em>\u202fgene that codes for aspartoacylase, a protein that breaks down a compound called N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Deficiency of aspartoacylase activity results in accumulation of NAA, and ultimately results in toxicity to myelin in ways that are not currently well understood. Myelin insulates neuronal axons, and without it, neurons are unable to send and receive messages as they should. The current standard of care for Canavan disease is limited to supportive therapy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><br \/>\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
