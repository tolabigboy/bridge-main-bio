(Nasdaq: BBIO), through its affiliate QED Therapeutics, Inc., and Helsinn Group today announced a global collaboration and licensing agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) to further develop and commercialize QED Therapeutics\u2019 FGFR1-3 inhibitor, infigratinib, in oncology and all other indications except for skeletal dysplasias (including achondroplasia). Completion of the Agreement is subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions, which are expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Infigratinib is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to inhibit FGFR, and being investigated for treatment of individuals with FGFR-driven conditions, including cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), urothelial carcinoma (urinary tract and bladder cancer), and other FGFR-driven cancers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Under the terms of the Agreement, BridgeBio will retain all rights to infigratinib in skeletal dysplasia, including achondroplasia. Subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approval, QED and Helsinn will co-commercialize infigratinib in oncology indications in the U.S. and will share profits and losses on a 50:50 basis. Helsinn will have exclusive commercialization rights and lead commercialization for infigratinib in non-skeletal dysplasia indications outside of the U.S., excluding China, Hong Kong and Macau, which are covered by BridgeBio\u2019s strategic development and commercialization collaboration with LianBio. Under the Agreement, BridgeBio will be eligible to receive more than $2 billion in upfront, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as tiered royalties on adjusted net sales from Helsinn Group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are privileged to partner with Helsinn as we strive to unlock the full potential of infigratinib for patients with FGFR-driven cancers,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder, Neil Kumar, Ph.D. \u201cHelsinn has an impressive track record of advancing and commercializing oncology therapies around the globe. Our hope is that partnering with Helsinn will significantly strengthen our anticipated upcoming launch of infigratinib and our ongoing research into infigratinib\u2019s potential across other cancer indications.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Riccardo Braglia, Helsinn Group Vice Chairman and CEO, commented, \u201cAs a leader in oncology therapeutics and supportive care, Helsinn is always looking to partner with high quality companies. The combination of BridgeBio and its lead oncology product candidate, infigratinib, fall into the strategic sweet spot of a quality company and product with which we look to work. We are highly excited by the potential positive impact this collaboration can deliver for patients around the world.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio and Helsinn Group intend to pursue an ambitious co-development plan in oncology indications, including clinical investigation underway in first-line cholangiocarcinoma and adjuvant urothelial cancer. This plan will be underpinned by close collaboration among the parties, with the aim of developing new treatments for patients with FGFR-driven cancers. As infigratinib heads toward potential approval and commercialization in a range of oncology indications, Helsinn\u2019s unique integrated licensing business model will enable its distribution to reach patients globally.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The FDA has accepted the New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) for infigratinib for patients with previously-treated advanced cholangiocarcinoma (\u201cCCA\u201d) harboring an FGFR2 gene fusion or rearrangement. The NDA has been granted Priority Review designation and is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (\u201cRTOR\u201d) pilot program, an initiative of the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence designed to expedite the delivery of safe and effective cancer treatments to patients. Additionally, infigratinib is currently under review in Australia and Canada under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence that allows for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international regulatory agencies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About QED Therapeutics, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>QED Therapeutics, an affiliate of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine for FGFR-driven diseases. Its lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown activity that it believes, based on published data to date, to be meaningful in clinical measures, such as overall response rate, in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration for second- and later-line cholangiocarcinoma in 2020. QED Therapeutics is also evaluating infigratinib in clinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia.
