(Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio),\u00a0a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that focuses on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced an update to their existing strategic collaboration to develop, manufacture and commercialize infigratinib for oncology indications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, Helsinn will gain an exclusive license to commercialize infigratinib in the U.S. and will be responsible for developing, manufacturing and commercializing infigratinib in oncology indications worldwide except for achondroplasia or any other skeletal dysplasias and except in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. BridgeBio will be eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as tiered royalties on adjusted net sales from Helsinn. BridgeBio will retain all rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize infigratinib in skeletal dysplasia, including achondroplasia.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, Helsinn and BridgeBio obtained accelerated approval for TRUSELTIQ\u2122 (infigratinib) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. Additionally, the two parties received conditional approval by Health Canada and provisional approval by the Therapeutics Goods Association in Australia for TRUSELTIQ\u2122 (infigratinib) for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement. Continued approval in the U.S., Canada and Australia for this indication may be contingent upon confirmatory trials.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Infigratinib is not FDA-, Health Canada- or Therapeutics Goods Association-approved for any other indication in the United States, Canada and Australia, and is not approved for use by any other health authority.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Giorgio Calderari, Helsinn Group CEO, commented, \u201cWe are delighted to gain the exclusive license to commercialize infigratinib in the U.S. This perfectly complements our recently announced Fully Integrated Targeted Therapy (FITT) Strategy and will utilize our unique capabilities and expertise to take products through development and to patients living with cancer across the globe. BridgeBio is a great partner, and we are looking forward to continuing our relationship with them through our non-exclusive collaboration framework to propose co-development and co-commercialization opportunities for preclinical precision oncology programs.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are expanding our partnership with Helsinn so that even more patients with FGFR-driven cancers will ultimately be able to access infigratinib. Focused execution means reducing the scope of our internal activity. We will continue to advance high-quality programs in our pipeline, while allowing Helsinn to develop and commercialize infigratinib in cancer indications for patients in need,\u201d said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., founder and CEO of BridgeBio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2021, Helsinn and BridgeBio entered into a global license and collaboration agreement to co-commercialize infigratinib for oncology in the U.S. and to co-develop, manufacture and commercialize infigratinib for such indications outside the U.S., excluding mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. BridgeBio previously entered a strategic collaboration with LianBio for development and commercialization of infigratinib in oncology indications in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2021, Helsinn and BridgeBio entered into a strategic collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize a potentially first-in-class inhibitor designed to target glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which will be investigated in patients with difficult-to-treat tumors. Alongside this, Helsinn and BridgeBio established a new non-exclusive collaboration framework agreement that allows the companies to propose co-development and co-commercialization opportunities for preclinical precision oncology programs. The terms in this strategic collaboration have not changed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Infigratinib<br \/><\/strong>Infigratinib is a potent orally administered, selective, ATP\u2010competitive, kinase inhibitor of FGFRs, with highest affinity for FGFR 1, 2, and 3. The therapy is currently under investigation as a potential first-line treatment for individuals with FGFR2-altered cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) and in the adjuvant setting for individuals with FGFR3-altered urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer). Infigratinib is also in development in skeletal dysplasias for the treatment of individuals with FGFR3-altered achondroplasia. BridgeBio retains full rights to develop and commercialize infigratinib in skeletal dysplasias for the treatment of individuals with FGFR3-altered achondroplasia.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)<br \/><\/strong>CCA represents an aggressive group of malignancies that form in the bile ducts. Although rare in most countries (with a worldwide estimated incidence of &lt;6 per 100,000 people), the incidence of this malignancy is increasing worldwide. Because the disease is usually asymptomatic at early-stages, diagnosis may be delayed until advanced stages, when CCA typically presents as locally advanced or metastatic disease. Despite continuing advances in treatments, the prognosis for this disease remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of &lt;20%. \u00a0FGFR2 genetic alterations are present in approximately 15% to 20% of CCA patients and represent potential targets for treatments.<sup>1,2<\/sup><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information for TRUSELTIQ (infigratinib)<br \/><\/strong>TRUSELTIQ (infigratinib) capsules 25mg\/100mg is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Accelerated approval was granted based on overall response rate and duration of response.
