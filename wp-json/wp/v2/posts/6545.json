Positive interactions with both the U.S. FDA and EMA support development in children with hypochondroplasia, with a small open-label Phase 2 portion testing a single dose of 0.25 mg\/kg\/day, leading into a double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study.\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ACCEL, the observational lead-in program for hypochondroplasia, was initiated with the first participant consented in May 2024. The interventional program, ACCEL 2\/3, will be a global Phase 2\/3 multicenter, single-dose study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.25mg\/kg\/day of infigratinib in children living with hypochondroplasia. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">The open-label Phase 2 portion in children aged 5 to 11 years old will be followed by a pivotal Phase 3, one-year, 2:1 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in children aged 3 to &lt; 18 years old with growth potential. In addition to changes from baseline in AHV measurements, the study will evaluate changes in other indicators of growth, body proportions, medical complications associated with hypochondroplasia, and changes in quality-of-life measures. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">BridgeBio has previously presented promising preclinical data for hypochondroplasia at ENDO 2023 and ASHG 2022.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cWe are very excited to see a persistence of response to infigratinib in linear growth. We are especially encouraged by the promising effect on body proportions, which supports infigratinib\u2019s potential to provide benefits that could impact the lives of children with achondroplasia. These results motivate us to continue evaluating infigratinib in other FGFR-related skeletal dysplasias and genetic conditions. The initiation of our observational study in hypochondroplasia and the obtainment of FDA and EMA alignment on the interventional study underlie our excitement for the potential of infigratinib as a treatment option for children with hypochondroplasia,\u201d said <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Daniela Rogoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Skeletal Dysplasias at BridgeBio.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cThe journey of living with skeletal dysplasia varies from person to person, but many are impacted by functional limitations, social stigma and medical complications due to their condition and the way their bones develop. We are encouraged to see infigratinib\u2019s potential to improve body proportionality, which could help address functional complications meaningful to people living with skeletal dysplasia. The Chandler Project values the collaborative partnership we\u2019ve developed with BridgeBio and QED, to ensure that the community\u2019s true needs are prioritized throughout the discovery and development process.

Achondroplasia impacts overall health and quality of life, leading to medical complications such as obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. The condition is uniformly caused by an activating variant in FGFR3.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">About Hypochondroplasia<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Hypochondroplasia is also an FGFR3-associated skeletal dysplasia and is a rare condition with similar prevalence in achondroplasia.

Currently, no treatments for hypochondroplasia are approved in the United States.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">BridgeBio Pharma (BridgeBio) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from genetic diseases.
