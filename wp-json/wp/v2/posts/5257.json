(Nasdaq: BBIO) (\u201cBridgeBio\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in ADventure, its Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of BBP-631, an investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV) 5 gene therapy for the treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases, with more than 75,000 cases estimated in the United States and European Union.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDosing the first patient in our CAH trial is a landmark milestone and we are grateful for the support from the medical and patient communities who helped us reach this moment. For more than 50 years people living with CAH have had the same limited standard of care \u2013 lifelong daily steroid replacement treatment. Our investigational gene therapy offers patients a potential single-dose intervention designed to restore their body\u2019s hormone and steroid balance by making their own cortisol and aldosterone,\u201d said Eric David, M.D., J.D., CEO at BridgeBio Gene Therapy. \u201cThis is the second gene therapy trial we have initiated in less than four months, and we are excited to advance this trial and our other gene therapy programs in the hope of improving patients\u2019 lives.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cAdults, children and families affected by CAH experience the daily burden of the disease and often, unfortunately, the side effects and morbidities associated with the current treatment regimens.\u00a0 As an endocrinologist, it\u2019s incredibly exciting to reimagine a new approach to treating this disease,\u201d added Adam Shaywitz, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer at BridgeBio Gene Therapy. Adrenas Therapeutics, the affiliate company of BridgeBio focused on developing BBP-631 for CAH, is part of BridgeBio Gene Therapy\u2019s portfolio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 1\/2 open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic activity of the company\u2019s AAV5 gene therapy, BBP-631, in adults with classic CAH. In the initial dose-finding phase of the study, each subject will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion. The primary outcomes of the study are safety, as well as change from baseline in endogenous cortisol levels which BBP-631 has the unique potential to restore. Change from baseline in steroid biomarkers for hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels and androstenedione (A4) levels will also be measured. Preclinical proof-of-concept data have shown the approach provides efficient and persistent delivery of functional 21-hydroxylase (21-OH) enzyme to the adrenal gland.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are honored to be the first site to administer gene therapy in a patient with CAH as it is a potential game-changing treatment option that targets the disease at its source,\u201d said Kyriakie Sarafoglou, M.D., associate professor and director of the Center for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe are eager to see whether\u00a0gene therapy can restore endogenous cortisol production, and also look forward to exploring its effect on the\u00a0physiological mechanisms that regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis including circadian and ultradian hormonal profiles.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio\u2019s investigational AAV5 gene therapy for CAH is one of the Company\u2019s 14 programs that are in the clinic or commercial setting for patients living with genetic diseases and cancers. Initial Phase 1\/2 data readouts of the Company\u2019s AAV5 gene therapy for CAH and the Company\u2019s AAV9 gene therapy for Canavan disease are expected in the second half of 2022.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the ADventure\u00a0trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04783181).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BBP-631<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-631 is an AAV5 gene therapy developed to treat CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency at its source. BBP-631 is designed to deliver a functional copy of the 21-hydroxylase gene and has been shown through multiple preclinical studies to result in efficient and persistent delivery to the adrenal gland, where hormones are naturally made. If successful<strong>, <\/strong>BBP-631 may restore the body\u2019s hormone and steroid balance by enabling people with CAH to naturally make their own cortisol and aldosterone. It could also allow for people with CAH to eliminate or significantly reduce their daily glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid doses, which is the current standard of care for patients.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Affecting approximately 75,000 people in the United States and European Union, CAH is a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands, which is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme essential for making the hormones cortisol and aldosterone which are critical for various physiologic functions. Cortisol is necessary for the body to respond to injury, stress or illness, and aldosterone is required to maintain proper blood pressure and sodium levels. Unable to produce cortisol and aldosterone, people with classic CAH cannot mount the healthy physiological response to stressors, such as illnesses, that allows their heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs to compensate for the stress, which can be life-threatening. These adrenal crises can be particularly dangerous for young children.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
