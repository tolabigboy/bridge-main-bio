(NASDAQ: BBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, has entered into a strategic collaboration with the University of Florida to translate research in genetically driven disease towards clinical development and potential commercialization. The partnership combines University of Florida\u2019s prowess in studying genetically driven disease, including its capabilities in gene therapy, with BridgeBio\u2019s expertise in efficiently advancing therapeutics from the academic laboratory through preclinical studies and into human testing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio believes that, too often, promising research in academia sits on the shelf without partners to move it forward. The company\u2019s mission is to bring as much of that research forward as possible, by focusing on establishing partnerships with leading institutions in the hopes of translating research into life-saving therapies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe scientists at University of Florida are recognized as leaders in research dedicated to genetically driven diseases, especially in the area of gene therapy. We are proud and eager to collaborate with them to push potential therapies forward for patients in need,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder Neil Kumar, Ph.D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio will provide sponsorship to select research programs around diseases with a genetic basis, including gene therapies and large and small molecules. The company will provide guidance for sponsored programs around medicinal chemistry for small-molecule hit optimization, strategies to modify or formulate a potential biologic therapy or approaches for testing non-optimized viral vectors. BridgeBio may conduct proof-of-concept studies for lead therapeutic compounds in relevant mammalian models.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cGreat academic research scientists at the University of Florida have produced groundbreaking research, and through a partnership with BridgeBio we hope to turn more of that research into approved medicines for patients,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Connell, assistant vice president for commercialization at University of Florida. \u201cBridgeBio has shown it understands the complexities in advancing gene therapies toward clinical development for patients in need \u2013 regardless of the size of an indication. We are encouraged by the company\u2019s ability to advance multiple programs in parallel and commitment to patient communities. It is gratifying to see a drug development company take inspiration from the work that we are doing.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio seeks to revolutionize partnerships between drug development companies and biomedical research institutions by moving away from one-off interactions and building long-term partnerships based on trust, engagement, science and respect. The company is committed to acting responsibly towards the academic investigators who are on the front lines of understanding the mechanisms of genetically driven diseases and have great insights into how these diseases may be treated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma<br \/><\/strong>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source. BridgeBio was founded in 2015 to identify and advance transformative medicines to treat patients who suffer from Mendelian diseases, which are diseases that arise from defects in a single gene, and cancers with clear genetic drivers. BridgeBio&#8217;s pipeline of over 20 development programs includes product candidates ranging from early discovery to late-stage development.
