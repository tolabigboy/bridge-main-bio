If proven effective, we then intend to move forward new combined drug strategies incorporating this target.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the preclinical studies, the Ivy Center will employ orthotopically implanted, well-characterized FGFR3 fusion patient-derived xenograft models. This is intended to allow the team to further explore the extent to which the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier and what activity it has in the brain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe believe the work we are undertaking with the Ivy Center will provide critical insight to shape our clinical development strategy for this disease,\u201c said Susan Moran, M.D., M.S.C.E., chief medical officer of QED Therapeutics. \u201cOur hope is that infigratinib will become the backbone of new combination therapies to treat patients with glioblastoma.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Infigratinib is an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor. QED Therapeutics has observed activity that appears to be meaningful in clinical trials for cancers that are driven by errors in the FGFR genes. These include chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genetic alterations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe intricacies of the brain have posed significant challenges for brain cancer research and the development of therapies,\u201d said Gary Li, head of translational medicine at QED Therapeutics. \u201cWe believe collaborating with the Ivy Brain Tumor Center will enable us to move swiftly and further translational research that we hope will unlock the doors to effective treatment options.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Ivy Brain Tumor Center<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ivybraintumorcenter.org\">Ivy Brain Tumor Center<\/a> at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ is a non-profit translational research program that employs a bold, early-phase clinical trials strategy to identify new treatments for aggressive brain tumors, including glioblastoma. The Ivy Center\u2019s Phase 0 clinical trials program is the largest of its kind in the world and enables personalized care in a fraction of the time and cost associated with traditional drug development. Unlike conventional clinical trials focusing on single drugs, its accelerated trials program tests therapeutic combinations matched to individual patients.

Our lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown activity that we believe to be meaningful in clinical measures such as overall response rate in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED is also evaluating infigratinib in preclinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia. We plan to conduct further clinical trials to evaluate the potential for infigratinib to treat patients with other FGFR-driven tumor types and rare disorders.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on QED Therapeutics, please visit the Company&#8217;s website at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qedtx.com\">www.qedtx.com<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bridgebio.com\/\">BridgeBio<\/a> is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
