(Eidos) (Nasdaq<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=fadJvXiPG2vQdW3oYYqJcgiR7t5-lLO8TzQfC9tqq2JRVllF3YVKRcR8j2FGCSN-PdH1aiC4pUXD37-fQdzCgw%3D%3D\">:EIDX) <\/a>today announced publication of the design and preclinical characterization of its lead product candidate, AG10, in the <a href=\"https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.8b00817\">Journal of Medicinal Chemistry<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 is designed to prevent progression of transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR) by stabilizing tetrameric TTR in the blood. AG10 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with symptomatic ATTR cardiomyopathy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=PDqyOJQLguF6av0zfLgKgBnFAujDn5AnYfltjnYS6bb7-qNIF6jPyr6T20QSvtYitWukBlZgde-vH7LJQ4C4MSdoc4aTm-63Rtrf-dVc1lU%3D\">(NCT03458130<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cStabilizing transthyretin has been validated as an approach for treating ATTR based on the correlation of genetic mutations with disease progression and the success of previous clinical trials in the disease. A comparison of various TTR stabilizers and their potency based on structural evidence has not been previously conducted,\u201d said Mamoun Alhamadsheh, PhD, co-founder of Eidos and associate professor at the University of the Pacific (Stockton, CA). \u201cWe believe our results provide strong evidence that AG10\u2019s potentially superior stabilizing activity is driven by its unique ability to mimic the disease-protective T119M mutation and its selectivity for binding TTR in the plasma.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The published paper demonstrates that AG10\u2019s binding to TTR is driven by molecular interactions that mimic the structure of the T119M TTR variant that is known to protect carriers from developing ATTR and leads to prolonged lifespan in otherwise healthy individuals. Using in vitro and ex vivo assays, the data indicated that:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>AG10 demonstrated more potent activity than other clinical candidates in binding and stabilizing the TTR tetramer at clinically relevant concentrations,<\/li>\r\n<li>the binding of AG10 to TTR was not significantly affected by the presence of additional plasma proteins such as albumin, and<\/li>\r\n<li>AG10 exhibited a predictable relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in animal studies.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThis newly published paper describes the preclinical support for AG10 and further validates AG10\u2019s mechanism to potently and selectively stabilize TTR,\u201d said Uma Sinha, PhD, chief scientific officer of Eidos. \u201cAs a result, AG10 has the potential to be a disease-modifying therapy for ATTR, which we are evaluating in our ongoing Phase 2 study in symptomatic ATTR cardiomyopathy patients.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About AG10<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 is an orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric transthyretin, or TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to amyloidosis, or ATTR. AG10 is currently being examined in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. Top-line results from this trial are expected to be reported by the end of 2018.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 was designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a \u201crescue mutation\u201d because it has been shown to prevent ATTR in individuals carrying pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutations in the TTR gene. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in development that has been observed to mimic the \u201csuper-stabilizing\u201d properties of this rescue mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Eidos Therapeutics<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Eidos Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the large and growing unmet need in diseases caused by transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR).
