(Nasdaq: BBIO) subsidiary Origin Biosciences, a company focused on developing and commercializing a treatment for Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Type A, and Medison Pharma Ltd., a leading commercial biotech partner that operates in Israel, Canada and Central and Eastern European countries, have entered into an exclusive license agreement under which Medison received rights from Origin to distribute, market, sell and otherwise commercialize Origin\u2019s drug product known as fosdenopterin (BBP-870\/ORGN001) in Israel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fosdenopterin is a cPMP replacement therapy designed to treat patients with MoCD Type A. Origin recently initiated the rolling submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fosdenopterin. Subsequent to FDA approval, Medison will be responsible for seeking the requisite regulatory approval and, once approved, commercializing fosdenoptrin in Israel. Origin will receive an upfront cash payment and will receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestone events and ongoing royalties on net sales of fosdenopterin in Israel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;Our partnership with Medison marks an important step in Origin\u2019s global commercial strategy and strengthens our ability to make fosdenopterin available to infants and children suffering from MoCD Type A,\u201d said Matt Outten, Chief Commercial Officer at BridgeBio. \u201cMedison has a strong commercial organization in Israel with a proven track record of successfully marketing orphan disease products. Its commercial infrastructure is uniquely suited to support patients suffering from rare diseases like MoCD Type A. We look forward to collaborating with Medison to enhance our efforts to help patients by targeting MoCD Type A at its source.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cOur promise is to assure that every patient under our responsibility has access to the best available treatments,\u201d said Meir Jakobsohn, the founder and CEO of Medison Pharma. \u201cThe partnership with Origin Biosciences echoes our shared internal values of scientific excellence.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fosdenopterin has received Orphan Drug Designation in the US and Europe, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States. Since the NDA for fosdenopterin is seeking approval of treatment for patients with a serious and life-threatening disease with no other treatment options (MoCD Type A), it is also eligible for Priority Review Designation, which, if granted, may further expedite the NDA review time for the potential approval of this new medicine in the United States.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Type A<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>MoCD Type A is an ultra-rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism caused by disruption in molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis that is vital for sulfite oxidase (SOX) activity. Patients are often infants with severe encephalopathy and intractable seizures. Disease progression is rapid with a high infant mortality rate.<sup>1,2<\/sup> Those who survive beyond the first few months experience profuse developmental delays and suffer the effects of irreversible neurological damage, including brain atrophy with white matter necrosis, dysmorphic facial features, and spastic paraplegia.<sup>1,4<\/sup> Clinical presentation that can be similar to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or other neonatal seizure disorders may lead to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.<sup>2,3<\/sup> Immediate testing for elevated sulfite levels and S-sulfocysteine in the urine and very low serum uric acid may help with suspicion of MoCD Type A.<sup>2,4<\/sup><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Origin Biosciences<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Origin Biosciences, a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma Inc., is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing a treatment for MoCD Type A.
