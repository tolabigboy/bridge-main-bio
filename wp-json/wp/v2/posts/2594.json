(NASDAQ: BBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, today announced that it is partnering with Shanghai-based LianBio, a new company founded by Perceptive Advisors, to expand its global reach into China, the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the world. The partnership marks the first major expansion of BridgeBio\u2019s pipeline into Asian markets.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This strategic relationship will initially focus on two of BridgeBio\u2019s targeted oncology drug candidates, FGFR inhibitor infigratinib, currently in Phase 3 development for FGFR-driven tumors and Phase 1-ready SHP2 inhibitor BBP-398, for tumors driven by RAS and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations. The agreement also provides LianBio with preferential future access in the territory to more than 20 drug development candidates currently owned or controlled by BridgeBio. This collaboration is designed to advance and accelerate BridgeBio\u2019s programs in China and other major Asian markets, allowing BridgeBio to quickly bring innovation to large numbers of patients with high unmet need.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cTremendous patient need and a fast-developing healthcare infrastructure make China a strategic priority. We are eager to not only expand late-stage therapies to the broader patient population there, but also to accelerate our clinical development efforts in Asia and better understand and address the needs of patients there \u2013 early. We are grateful to be deepening our relationship with Perceptive Advisors through this agreement with LianBio and look forward to a lasting partnership focused on expanding our reach to patients,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and founder Neil Kumar, Ph.D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe value our relationship with BridgeBio and are happy to be enabling the entry of important programs to LianBio\u2019s territories,\u201d said Adam Stone, CIO of Perceptive Advisors. \u201cBridgeBio and its affiliate companies exemplify the commitment to science-driven, precision medicine that we believe is a key driver to innovation in healthcare. We are excited about this opportunity to leverage their promising pipeline and LianBio\u2019s local expertise to accelerate both global development and local access to leading edge therapeutics.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Under the terms of the agreements, LianBio will receive commercial rights in China and selected Asian markets and participate in clinical development activities for infigratinib (housed in BridgeBio affiliate QED) and BBP-398 (housed in BridgeBio affiliate Navire). BridgeBio\u2019s near-term economics includes a total of $26.5 million in upfront and milestone payments. BridgeBio will receive up to $505 million in future milestone payments, tiered royalty payments from single- to double-digits on net sales of both products in licensed territories. Additionally, BridgeBio will increase its equity interest via investment in LianBio and BridgeBio CEO Neil Kumar has been appointed to the LianBio board of directors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>LianBio is participating in the ongoing Phase 3 study of infigratinib in first line cholangiocarcinoma (PROOF) in mainland China and further plans to initiate a Phase 2a study of infigratinib in gastric cancer and other FGFR-driven tumors. Additionally, LianBio will contribute to clinical development of BBP-398 in combination with various agents in solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal and pancreatic cancer, in mainland China and other major Asian markets. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma<\/strong><br \/>BridgeBio is a team of experienced drug discoverers, developers and innovators working to create life-altering medicines that target well-characterized genetic diseases at their source.
