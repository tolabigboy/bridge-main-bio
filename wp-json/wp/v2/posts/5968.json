The primary endpoint analysis was highly statistically significant with a Win Ratio of 1.8 (p&lt;0.0001).<\/li>\n<li>A clinically meaningful and consistent treatment effect was observed across all measures of mortality, morbidity, function, and quality of life.<\/li>\n<li>An on-treatment survival rate of 81% was observed, versus a placebo survival rate of 74% (absolute risk reduction of 6.43%; relative risk reduction of 25%).<\/li>\n<li>A highly statistically significant relative risk reduction of 50% (p&lt;0.0001) was observed on frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization.<\/li>\n<li>In comparative exploratory post hoc analyses enabled by tafamidis drop-in, albeit at low patient numbers, acoramidis showed a 42% greater increase in serum TTR levels and a 92% improvement in median NT-proBNP relative to placebo + tafamidis.<\/li>\n<li>Acoramidis was well-tolerated with no safety signals of potential clinical concern identified.<\/li>\n<li>BridgeBio intends to file an NDA for acoramidis with the FDA by end of 2023 and marketing authorization applications with additional regulatory authorities globally in 2024.<\/li>\n<li>The details of the topline results of the ATTRibute-CM trial will be presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology, one of the premier global cardiology congresses, in Amsterdam at the end of August 2023.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Low-dose infigratinib \u2013 FGFR1-3 inhibitor for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia:<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>In June 2023, the Company presented updated six-month results from Cohort 5 of PROPEL2, its Phase 2 trial of infigratinib for children with achondroplasia, at ENDO 2023; the data demonstrated a significant and robust increase in annualized height velocity (AHV) with a mean change from baseline of +3.38 cm\/year for 12 children.<\/li>\n<li>83% of children in Cohort 5 responded to infigratinib, as defined by an increase from baseline AHV of at least 25%. The mean change from baseline in AHV of responders was +4.08 cm\/year.<\/li>\n<li>Early but promising trends towards improvement in proportionality were observed, as measured by the upper and lower body segment ratio.<\/li>\n<li>At six months, infigratinib was well-tolerated as a single daily oral therapy with no adverse events assessed as treatment-related in all patients in Cohort 5.<\/li>\n<li>The Company has started to enroll children in the run-in for a registrational Phase 3 trial.<\/li>\n<li>If approved, BridgeBio believes that infigratinib has the potential to capture a significant share of the market based on blinded market research.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>BBP-418 \u2013 Glycosylation substrate for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I\/R9 (LGMD2I\/R9):<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>The Company met with the FDA to discuss the use of glycosylated \u03b1DG levels as a surrogate endpoint. Based on this meeting, the Company believes there is potential to pursue Accelerated Approval in the U.S. for BBP-418.<\/li>\n<li>The Company has dosed the first participant in FORTIFY, its global Phase 3 study of BBP-418 in patients with LGMD2I\/R9.<\/li>\n<li>FORTIFY includes an interim analysis at 12 months focused on change in glycosylated \u03b1DG levels; topline data from this analysis is expected in late 2024\/early 2025.<\/li>\n<li>Deficiency of glycosylated \u03b1DG is the causal molecular driver of LGMD2I\/R9. In the ongoing Phase 2 study, patients treated with BBP-418 had a rapid and sustained increase of glycosylated \u03b1DG levels, concurrent with sustained decreases in creatine kinase and improvements from baseline in ambulatory and clinical function measures.<\/li>\n<li>BBP-418 has a potentially addressable population of 7,000 patients in the United States and European Union.<\/li>\n<li>There are currently no disease-modifying treatments available for LGMD2I\/R9.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Encaleret \u2013 Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) inhibitor for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1):<\/strong>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>The Company presented 18-month data from the long-term extension of its Phase 2 study of encaleret in patients with ADH1 at ENDO 2023, including observations of a rapid and sustained treatment effect.

The net decrease of $113.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term restricted cash is primarily attributable to net cash used in operating activities of $257.7 million, offset by net proceeds received of $144.0 million from the Follow-on public offering during the six months ended June 30, 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenue for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2023 was $1.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively, as compared to $73.7 million and $75.4 million for the same periods in the prior year. Revenue for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2023 primarily consisted of $1.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of services revenue under the Navire-BMS License Agreement. Revenue for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2022 primarily consisted of $70.2 million of license revenue and $3.2 million of services revenue under the Navire-BMS License Agreement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Operating Costs and Expenses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Operating costs and expenses for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2023 were $147.7 million and $275.7 million, respectively, compared to $153.9 million and $329.3 million for the same periods in the prior year. The overall decrease in operating costs and expenses for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2023 compared to the comparative periods was due mainly to the decreases in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses resulting from the Company&#8217;s reprioritization of its R&amp;D programs; selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from its company-wide streamlining of costs; and restructuring, impairment and related charges since the majority of the restructuring initiatives commenced in the first quarter of 2022. The effects of the Company&#8217;s restructuring initiative which commenced in the first quarter of 2022, continue to be realized due to the Company&#8217;s reductions in operating costs and expenses. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2023, amounted to $3.5 million and $6.9 million, respectively. These charges primarily consisted of winding down, exit costs, and severance and employee-related costs. Restructuring, impairment and related charges for the same periods in the prior year were $8.4 million and $31.1 million, respectively. These charges primarily consisted of impairments and write-offs of long-lived assets, severance and employee-related costs, and exit and other related costs. The Company remains committed to evaluating various restructuring alternatives aimed at driving operational changes in business processes. These alternatives includes enhancing commercialization efforts, improving efficiencies, and achieving cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the three months ended June\u00a030, 2023 were $27.2 million, of which $13.2 million is included in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses, $14.0 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the three months ended June\u00a030, 2022 were $28.3 million, of which $14.3 million is included in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses, and $14.0 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2023 were $50.7 million, of which $25.0 million is included in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses, $25.7 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses included in operating costs and expenses for the six months ended June\u00a030, 2022 were $52.6 million, of which $22.9 million is included in research, development and other (R&amp;D) expenses, $28.5 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $1.2 million is included in restructuring, impairment and related charges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFollowing the recent announcement and strength of our Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM data, we will continue to explore multiple options to fully resource the acoramidis launch while optimizing cost of capital, including partnerships, royalty transactions, and equity financing,\u201d said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., CFA, Chief Financial Officer of BridgeBio. \u201cWe anticipate $300-$350 million of investment will support acoramidis from here through the first 12 months of commercial launch.
