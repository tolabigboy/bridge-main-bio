(NASDAQ: BBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, create, test and deliver meaningful medicines for patients with genetic diseases and cancers with clear genetic drivers, and affiliate QED Therapeutics today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted their New Drug Application (NDA) for infigratinib, an oral FGFR1-3 selective inhibitor, for individuals with cholangiocarcinoma, or cancer of the bile ducts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The NDA has been granted Priority Review designation and is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, an initiative of the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence designed to expedite the delivery of safe and effective cancer treatments to patients. Additionally, BridgeBio will submit for review in Australia and Canada under Project Orbis, an initiative of the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence that allows for concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among participating international regulatory agencies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts of the liver, is a serious and often fatal disease which affects approximately 20,000 people in the United States and European Union each year. FGFR2 genetic aberrations are present in approximately 15% to 20% of people who have this disease. Currently, treatment options are limited, and the five-year survival rate is only 9%.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe want to thank the patients, families, scientists, physicians and all others involved who helped us move this NDA forward. At BridgeBio we believe that every minute counts for patients and their families, and we are eager to help as many people suffering from cholangiocarcinoma as possible \u2013 as quickly as possible,\u201d said BridgeBio CEO and Founder Neil Kumar, Ph.D.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is BridgeBio\u2019s second NDA acceptance following the acceptance of its NDA for fosdenopterin in molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A in September 2020.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Infigratinib<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Infigratinib is an orally administered, ATP-competitive, FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of individuals with FGFR-driven conditions, including cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) and achondroplasia, a bone growth condition in children.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About QED Therapeutics<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>QED Therapeutics, an affiliate of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on precision medicine for FGFR-driven diseases. Its lead investigational candidate is infigratinib (BGJ398), an orally administered, FGFR1-3 selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown activity that it believes, based on published data to date, to be meaningful in clinical measures, such as overall response rate, in patients with chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions and advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 genomic alterations. QED submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration for second- and later-line cholangiocarcinoma in 2020. QED Therapeutics is also evaluating infigratinib in clinical studies for the treatment of achondroplasia. QED plans to conduct further clinical trials to evaluate the potential for infigratinib to treat patients with other FGFR-driven tumor types and rare disorders.
