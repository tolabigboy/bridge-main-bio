(Nasdaq: BBIO) subsidiary Origin Biosciences has initiated a rolling submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fosdenopterin (BBP-870\/ORGN001) for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, there are no approved therapies that alter the course of MoCD Type A, which results in severe and irreversible neurological injury. Fosdenopterin, an investigative cPMP substrate replacement therapy, aims to reduce buildup of toxic sulfites and alleviate central nervous system symptoms in infants and children with MoCD Type A.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cInitiation of our rolling NDA submission is a significant milestone for our company\u00a0and an important step in providing a therapy to patients and their families living\u00a0with MoCD Type A,\u201d said Origin Biosciences CEO Neil Kirby, Ph.D. \u201cWe look forward to making fosdenopterin available to infants and children with this devastating disease as soon as possible as they currently have no treatment options that target the disease at its source.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cBridgeBio was founded to develop breakthrough medicines for patients with genetic diseases. As we begin our first rolling new drug application with the FDA, we are taking a significant step forward for patients by targeting MoCD Type A at its source through the provision of the monophosphate cPMP. We want to thank patients and their families, the scientists, and all others involved who helped us reach this critical moment,\u201d BridgeBio CEO Neil Kumar, Ph.D., said. \u201cOur growing company has more than 15 drug discovery and development programs. We hope Origin\u2019s NDA will be the first of many we submit to the FDA in our pursuit of life-changing therapies for patients, including an anticipated submission in 2020 from BridgeBio subsidiary QED Therapeutics for infigratinib for second line treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The regulatory submission will primarily be supported by data from two ongoing trials, a global Phase 2 clinical trial (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT02629393?term=NCT02629393&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\">NCT02629393<\/a>) and a global Phase 2\/3 clinical trial (<a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT02047461?term=NCT02047461&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1\">NCT02047461<\/a>). Under its rolling review process, the FDA can review components of a marketing application as they are submitted rather than requiring all components to be received prior to initiating review, potentially allowing for faster review of the application.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-870 has received Orphan Drug Designation in the US and Europe, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the US. Since the NDA for fosdenopterin is seeking approval of treatment for patients with a serious and life-threatening disease with no other treatment options (MoCD Type A), it is also eligible for Priority Review Designation, which, if granted, may further expedite the NDA review time for the NDA approval of this new medicine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency (MoCD) Type A<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>MoCD Type A is an ultra-rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism caused by disruption in molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis that is vital for sulfite oxidase (SOX) activity. Patients are often infants with severe encephalopathy and intractable seizures. Disease progression is rapid with a high infant mortality rate.<sup>1,2\u00a0\u00a0<\/sup>Those who survive beyond the first few months experience profuse developmental delays and suffer the effects of irreversible neurological damage, including brain atrophy with white matter necrosis, dysmorphic facial features, and spastic paraplegia.<sup>1,4<\/sup>\u00a0Clinical presentation that can be similar to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or other neonatal seizure disorders may lead to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.<sup>2,3<\/sup>\u00a0Immediate testing for elevated sulfite levels and S-sulfocysteine in the urine and very low serum uric acid may help with suspicion of MoCD Type A.<sup>2,4<\/sup><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Origin Biosciences<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Origin Biosciences, a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing a treatment for MoCD Type A.
