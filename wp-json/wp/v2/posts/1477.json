AG10 is a small molecule designed to treat the root cause of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) \u2013 destabilized and misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein \u2013 by binding and stabilizing TTR in the blood. Eidos is currently evaluating AG10 in a Phase 3 study in the U.S. and Europe for ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) \u2013 a progressive, fatal disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR amyloid in the heart \u2013 and plans to begin a Phase 3 study in ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) \u2013 a progressive, fatal disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR amyloid in the peripheral nervous system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;There is a significant need for new treatments for TTR amyloidosis. We believe AG10 holds promise in its ability to stabilize TTR and halt disease progression,\u201d said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research &amp; Development at Alexion. \u201cWe are excited by the potential to grow our amyloidosis portfolio by partnering with Eidos to expand the development of AG10 to Japan. Alexion has more than 10 years of experience operating there, and we look forward to applying our expertise to bring AG10 to Japanese patients.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;The Phase 2 study in ATTR-CM suggested that AG10 has the potential to become an important treatment option for the underserved ATTR-CM population. The trial showed that AG10 was generally well-tolerated and resulted in near-complete stabilization of TTR, which is known to be correlated with disease severity in ATTR-CM. In the study, AG10 also normalized serum TTR levels, a prognostic indicator of survival in ATTR patients,&#8221; said Jonathan Fox, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Medical Officer of Eidos. &#8220;We have now begun our Phase 3 program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AG10 in larger studies. This agreement provides the potential opportunity to help even more patients globally by leveraging Alexion\u2019s significant development and commercial experience to expand the AG10 program into Japan.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will acquire an exclusive license for the clinical development and commercialization of AG10 in Japan. Eidos will receive an upfront payment of $25 million and an equity investment of $25 million at a premium to the market price upon deal execution, with the potential for additional Japanese-based milestone- and royalty-dependent payments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About AG10<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 is an investigational, orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric transthyretin, or TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to TTR amyloidosis, or ATTR. In a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM, AG10 was generally well tolerated, demonstrated greater than 90 percent average TTR stabilization at Day 28, and increased serum TTR concentrations, a prognostic indicator of survival in a retrospective study of ATTR-CM patients, in a dose-dependent manner.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AG10 was designed to mimic a naturally-occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a rescue mutation because co-inheritance has been shown to prevent or ameliorate ATTR in individuals also inheriting a pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutation in the TTR gene. To our knowledge, AG10 is the only TTR stabilizer in development that has been observed to mimic the stabilizing structure of this rescue mutation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 3 ATTRibute-CM study of AG10 in patients with ATTR-CM is underway in the United States and Europe. Part A of the study will assess the change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 12 months. Part B of the study will evaluate reduction in all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations will be evaluated at 30 months. In addition, Eidos plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of AG10 in ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) in the second half of 2019.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There is significant medical need in transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) given the large patient population and an inadequate current standard of care. ATTR is caused by the destabilization of TTR due to inherited mutations or aging and is commonly divided into three distinct categories: wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM), mutant ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRm-CM), and ATTR polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN). The worldwide prevalence of each disease is approximately 400,000 patients, 40,000 patients and 10,000 patients, respectively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All three forms of ATTR are progressive and fatal. For patients with untreated ATTRwt-CM and ATTRm-CM, symptoms usually manifest later in life (age 50+), with median survival of three to five years from diagnosis. ATTR-PN either presents in a patient&#8217;s early 30s or later (age 50+), and results in a median life expectancy of five to ten years from diagnosis for untreated patients. Progression of all forms of ATTR causes significant morbidity, impacts productivity and quality of life, and creates a significant economic burden due to the costs associated with progressively greater patient needs for supportive care.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Alexion<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases through the discovery, development and commercialization of life-changing therapies.
