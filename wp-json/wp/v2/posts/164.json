BridgeBio has committed funding to drive the program toward clinical studies. CoA Therapeutics&#8217; lead compound will be entering the clinic in 2019 with a planned initial focus on pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, or PKAN.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PKAN is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (<em>PANK2<\/em>) gene. The PANK2 enzyme plays a critical role in the synthesis of CoA, which is crucial in energy metabolism and implicated in a large number of developmental disorders. Patients with PKAN either have a complete absence or a significant deficiency of the PANK2 enzyme, which may lead to reduced CoA levels in the brain. There are currently no treatments approved for PKAN.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CoA Therapeutics&#8217; lead compounds, which were obtained under a license from St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, were discovered and developed by St. Jude investigators\u00a0Suzanne Jackowski, Ph.D.,\u00a0Charles Rock, Ph.D.,\u00a0Richard Lee, Ph.D., and\u00a0Stephen White, Ph.D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The prevalence of PKAN is estimated to be three in every 1,000,000 people. In the typical form of PKAN, symptoms present before the age of 10, and patients may rapidly experience neuronal degeneration, causing problems with movement, speech and vision.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;PKAN is a progressive, debilitating disease with no current approved therapy, and patients and their families currently rely on supportive treatments, which partially address the symptoms but not the root cause,&#8221; said\u00a0Shafique Virani, M.D., CEO of CoA. &#8220;We believe that our novel approach, using a highly brain-penetrant compound to directly target enzyme activity in neurons, can safely increase CoA levels, ease patients&#8217; symptoms and make a meaningful difference in their quality of life. Our novel approach also holds promise for other diseases with defects in CoA metabolism, including the organic acidemias.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Joining Dr. Virani is\u00a0Adam Shaywitz, M.D., Ph.D., who will serve as chief medical officer at CoA as well as CMO-in-residence at BridgeBio. Shaywitz was most recently executive director in clinical sciences at BioMarin Pharmaceuticals where he was involved in the design and planning of a number of clinical studies in rare disease including serving as program lead for the natural history and clinical treatment studies in Sanfilippo Syndrome B (MPS IIIB). \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8220;We are privileged to be working with Drs. Jackowski, Rock, Lee and White, who have been at the forefront of CoA metabolism research in health and disease,&#8221; said\u00a0Neil Kumar, Ph.D., CEO of BridgeBio. &#8220;Their novel approach, which relies on increasing activity of the PANK enzyme family, is a great example of an allosteric agonist approach to potentially treat patients who have very few options.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma<br \/><\/strong>BridgeBio is a clinical-stage biotech company developing novel, genetically targeted therapies to improve the lives of patients.
