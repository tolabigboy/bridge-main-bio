Forward-Looking Statements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This press release contains forward-looking statements. Statements we make in this press release may include statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which are usually identified by the use of words such as \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d and variations of such words or similar expressions. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act and are making this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. These forward-looking statements, including statements relating to expectations, plans and prospects regarding the preclinical and clinical development plans, clinical trial designs, clinical and therapeutic potential, and strategy of our product candidates, including, but not limited to: interim results from the Phase 2b proof-of-concept, open-label study of encaleret for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia Type 1 (ADH1); and the timing of these events, reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and will be affected by a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to: ongoing data from our ongoing Phase 2b proof-of-concept, open-label study of encaleret for the treatment of ADH1 not being indicative of final data; the potential size of the target patient population for ADH1 not being as large as anticipated; encaleret not being well-tolerated, with serious adverse events and adverse events of moderate or severe intensity being reported in the final Phase 2b study data; encaleret not continuing to demonstrate that it may be an efficacious therapy option for ADH1 based on the final Phase 2b data; encaleret not being the first approved therapy option indicated specifically for the treatment of ADH1, if the development program is not successful or if a competing therapy option is approved; the design and success of ongoing and planned clinical trials, future regulatory filings, approvals and\/or sales; despite having ongoing and future interactions with the FDA or other regulatory agencies to discuss potential paths to registration prior to initiation of a Phase 3 registrational study of encaleret in patients with ADH1, the FDA or such other regulatory agencies may not agree with our regulatory approval strategies, components of our filings, such as clinical trial designs, conduct and methodologies, or the sufficiency of data submitted; the continuing success of our close collaboration between the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the National Institutes of Health; potential adverse impacts due to the global COVID-19 pandemic such as delays in regulatory review, manufacturing and supply chain interruptions, adverse effects on healthcare systems and disruption of the global economy; and those risks set forth in the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and our other SEC filings. Moreover, BridgeBio operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new risks emerge from time to time. These forward-looking statements are based upon the current expectations and beliefs of BridgeBio\u2019s management as of the date of this release and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we assume no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BridgeBio Contact:<\/strong><br \/>\nGrace Rauh<br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:Grace.rauh@bridgebiodev.wpengine.com\"><strong>Grace.rauh@bridgebiodev.wpengine.com<\/strong><\/a><br \/>\n(917) 232-5478<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8211; BridgeBio will host an investor call on June 13, 2022, at 4:30 pm ET to discuss the Phase 2b study results and the planned pivotal Phase 3 study design PALO ALTO, CA \u2013 June 9, 2022 \u2014 BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
