(Nasdaq: BBIO), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases and cancers, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in CAN<em>aspire<\/em>, its Phase 1\/2 clinical trial of BBP-812, an investigational adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9 gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease. Canavan disease is an ultra-rare and fatal disease that affects approximately 1,000 children in the United States and European Union. There are currently no approved therapies for the condition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDosing the first patient in our Canavan disease trial is a significant achievement for our gene therapy team and we would not be here without the support of our collaborative partners in the patient, medical and scientific communities,\u201d said Eric David, M.D., J.D., CEO at BridgeBio Gene Therapy. \u201cWe are committed to the Canavan community and will work to advance this trial and the other programs in our gene therapy portfolio because we believe deeply in the potential of gene therapy to improve and save lives.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cBased on the efficacy and safety data we\u2019ve observed in our preclinical studies, we are hopeful that our investigational gene therapy can become a meaningful treatment option for children living with Canavan. Right now, these children only have access to supportive care because there are currently no approved therapies to treat this devastating disease,\u201d added Adam Shaywitz, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer at BridgeBio Gene Therapy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Phase 1\/2 open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic activity of the company\u2019s AAV9 gene therapy, BBP-812, in pediatric patients with Canavan disease. In the initial dose-finding phase of the study, each patient will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of BBP-812. The primary outcomes of the study are safety, as well as change from baseline of urine and central nervous system N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels. Motor function and development will also be assessed. Preclinical proof-of-concept data have shown the approach restores survival and normal motor function.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cGene therapy is designed to treat diseases at their source, which for Canavan disease would be an extremely beneficial treatment option. Through this trial, we hope to provide evidence that this investigational therapy could represent a promising treatment option for Canavan patients and their families. We are grateful to the first family for participating,\u201d said Florian Eichler, M.D., director of the Leukodystrophy Service and principal investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital, the first clinical site open in the CAN<em>aspire<\/em> trial.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio\u2019s gene therapy was originally developed by Guangping Gao, Ph.D., and Dominic J. Gessler, M.D., Ph.D., at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Dr. Gao, a pioneer in AAV gene therapy, was also the first person to clone the <em>ASPA<\/em> gene, which in its mutated form causes Canavan disease. Dr. Gao has been working on developing a cure for Canavan disease for more than 25 years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThroughout my career, I\u2019ve been passionate about connecting with families in the Canavan community to understand how to help them through their journey. After decades of research and work, I\u2019m thrilled that we have dosed the first patient in this trial. I\u2019m hopeful that this represents a meaningful turning point for the Canavan community,\u201d said Dr. Gao, co-director of the Li Weibo Institute for Rare Diseases Research, director of the Horae Gene Therapy Center and Viral Vector Core, and professor at University of Massachusetts Medical School.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio\u2019s investigational AAV9 gene therapy for Canavan disease is one of the Company\u2019s 14 programs that are in the clinic or commercial setting for patients living with genetic diseases and genetically-driven cancers. An initial Phase 1\/2 data readout for Canavan disease is expected in 2022.\u00a0 For more information about the CAN<em>aspire<\/em> trial, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/treatcanavan.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TreatCanavan.com<\/a> or ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04998396).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BBP-812<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BBP-812 is an investigational AAV9 gene therapy for Canavan disease. Using AAV gene therapy, BridgeBio seeks to deliver functional copies of the <em>ASPA <\/em>gene throughout the body and into the brain, potentially correcting the disease at its source. Preclinical proof-of-concept results in Canavan disease models have shown the approach restores survival and normal motor function. \u00a0BBP-812 was granted Fast Track Designation, Rare Pediatric Drug Designation, and Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. BBP-812 was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Canavan Disease<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Affecting approximately 1,000 children in the United States and European Union, Canavan disease is an ultra-rare, disabling and fatal disease with no approved therapy. Most children are not able to meet developmental milestones, are unable to crawl, walk, sit or talk, and pass away at a young age. The disease is caused by an inherited mutation of the <em>ASPA<\/em> gene, which codes for aspartoacylase, a protein that breaks down a compound called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA). Deficiency of aspartoacylase activity results in accumulation of NAA, and ultimately results in toxicity to myelin in ways that are not well understood. Myelin insulates the nerves, and without it, neurons are unable to send and receive messages as they should. The current standard of care is limited to supportive therapy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.
